        "post": " I'm a fresh college student, and truth be told, I've been an average student, the \"study a few days before exams\" type procrastinator in high school. Surprisingly, it worked for me because I paid attention in class and retained information, even if I didn't hit the books regularly. \n\nHowever, in college, it has changed. Those high school classes weren't very interactive, and we never really asked questions outside the box, or we never really pondered about anything more than what was given in the textbook. In college, we have very interactive sessions, forcing you to think for yourself, to come up with ideas instead of just googling or reading given material. I am not proud to say that I have been a lazy person who has more knowledge about social media, movies and celebrities than current affairs. But I want to improve. I love the vibe of the classes here. Everyone is enthusiastic and knowledgeable. How do I change myself?\n\nFor example, I find myself struggling in a given 15 minutes brainstorming session to come up with an idea for MNC in emerging ideas and do research on it to present in front of the class.... instead of productive research, I end up wasting time googling stuff from unacademic sources and ending up with nothing reliable. What are some good sources for academic research? where do I get good material? How do I develop my analytical skills? How do I bring out my creativity and innovation to think outside the box? How do I efficiently research to use my time optimally? Any book recommendations to be more conprehensive, creative and analytical?",

        "post": "Hello everyone. I'm a 21 year old student and as you can see from the title I feel beaten. I moved to Europe 2.5 years ago to study computer engineering. I was a successful student at my country and I thought it'd continue here as well. But after 2.5 years I have only managed to pass 1 exam. I've never studied properly and always procrastinated until it was too late. It wasn't only because I was lazy but I'm also struggling with my social life, physical health and depression. So I decided to play videogames, watch shows and spend my time on social media. With every examination session coming I started studying for a bit and stop after a while because I get too nervous that I'd never be able to catch up. This is one of these times for me. I've decided to continue until the very last moment but I don't know if I'll be able to success. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what the issue with me is but I can't seem to understand anything my calculus professors say.  I take notes from the video lectures, try to solve problems from the book but nothing helps. I know I barely started but I feel like my brain is struggling so much when learning these topics. Even though the foundation of calculus is something I learned in high school, the university level feels too much for me. I just stare at the questions asking proofs, explanations and that kind of stuff. I'm good with calculating but I feel this is too abstract for me. And this is just one of my courses. I feel like there's so much for me to do beside just going to the lectures and I have to collect every bit of information from different sources and find relatable practice questions. At this point I just want to give up. Computer engineering isn't my biggest dream but the premise of live it might give me seems good enough to study. I'm thinking about changing majors but I don't know what to choose. I don't want to regret my decision again. I kind of want to quit university but I feel like this is something my brain romanticizes. I don't know what to do if I quit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if this is not very well put together, it's very late and I can't sleep. I'm waiting for your advices and thoughts. Thanks for taking the time to read.",

It was always Tiktok, Twitter, Youtube, Netflix, and etc. I have a problem getting distracted or not having the energy to finish assignments. Before the pandemic I was always focused on school, keeping up with assignments, and studying in the library. After a tough breakup a year ago, my mind went lost and I started becoming lazier.  I'm at the point that I'm aware of my mental state and should pick up the slack immediately before it's too late. I'm mostly on my phone and playing video games and I really want to get back to school. The addiction of being on social media and playing games till 3 am is getting worrisome. Does anyone have suggestions to keep me from being distracted or lazy? Any alternatives to focus on school more? Anything to fix procrastination?",

        "post": "1): It's *okay* to skip class, but you have to be methodical about it. If your professor is basically just reading aloud from a textbook that you can read yourself, a skip now and then is fine if you need to work on something else or if you're genuinely exhausted and need to rest a little (You're not going to get much from a lecture in that state anyway). \n\n2): Sometimes \"studying smarter\" is accepting the fact that you have a janky professor who contrives exams out of thin air, and not wasting time studying material that you and everyone else knows will NOT be on the exam. I'm not saying you shouldn't study *at all* in cases like this, but you need to allocate your time using common sense.\n\n3): No matter how introverted you are, try and get least least one texting buddy per class. It helps to have someone to discuss the material with, and it can be a Godsend on homework sometimes.\n\n4): Virtually everyone procrastinates, so don't feel guilty about it. That said, a lot of procrastination comes from simple psychological walls that are easily gotten rid of (keeping your books in your bag as opposed to taking them out when you get home, for instance).\n\n5): If you're planning on going to grad school, be proactive asking professors for reference letters ahead of time, and don't wait until your last year/semester. Waiting isn't really a big deal if you did well in the class and know the professor, but if you're proactive, it makes the whole process of collecting references less of a task when the witching hour comes.\n\n6): It's perfectly okay to have a good time every now and then for the sake of the \"college experience\", but never forget why you came to school to begin with. I've seen too many people with great potential post images and videos of themselves on social media at frat parties almost every night (And as you might guess, not many of them finished school).  ",

        "post": "A lot of ppl are probably in the same boat as me, but hear me out.\n\nBefore the pandemic, I was a nearly straight A student who was punctual, focused, and driven. Nowadays, I find myself willing to accept a C with with these online do-it-yourself classes. All my good school habits are out the window, and now I'm trying to remember how to take notes again. I feel like I'm getting borderline ADHD in that I can't sit still anymore or focus in class, even outside of class. I'm more forgetful than ever too. I know a change of scenery for hw or classes would help, but it still feels different than being on campus. I haven't been back on campus yet as my classes don't need to, but I should next term (Winter 2022). These days, I'm also late for everything, and don't care to go out and see friends anymore like I used to. Leaving the house at all is so draining, but staying in all day is also draining. I've also seemed to have lost the same drive I used to have for my degree, even tho I love biology. Depression doesn't help, but I have meds for that. To make matters worse, I'm developing a horrible procrastinating habit that I don't want to take back to campus life. \n\nAs people start going back on campus and numbers continue to rise, I wonder if I'll ever be able to go back to how I was before the pandemic when it comes to education and discipline. It's obvious things will never be the same, but how do I get back to that work ethic and drive I had before? Has the transition back to campus been an easy one for others? I just want to know what other ppl have to say on this matter, because there's no way I'm the only one.",

Procrastinating and motivation were my main problems which is now the opposite! \n\nAny type of advice would be greatly appreciated, I\u2019m planning on taking a full course load and just completely dedicating everything to school as I quit working to do this. Any advice on preparing mentally and classes/amount of classes?

Just ... please, do the bare minimum if that's what makes you pass the class. Look I know it's not glamorous. It doesn't even seem like an option - especially when your ideas are quite brilliant. or when you've been told you have so much potential your entire life. or when you've been told anything less than an A is mediocre. You might wanna \"prove\" yourself as exceptional... but trust me. *Exceptional is overrated*. Exceptional with bad grades won't get you into grad school. You don't wanna deal with repeating courses you failed (like I am right now) or depression because you cared too much about writing the perfect essay to the point where you never handed it in.",

Thanks.\n\nEdit: I always procrastinate heavily but still end up scoring decently which always makes me wonder how well I might do if I could get around this issue. Instead of a bit of work each week I end up sitting down at my desk for hours each just for weeks just to catch up. I also have a massive fear of starting that\u2019s holding me back.

I'm on track to fail a class for the first time in my life (there is still hope though, so fingers crossed).* \n\n*For some reason, my productivity took a Niagra Falls dip this summer: difficulty starting up a study session, low energy, procrastination...you name it. I couldn't figure out why. Simply shrugged it off as inevitable burnout and \"oh it's COVID blah blah\".*\n\nThat is until I had a r/showerthoughts moment this morning. You see, I'm an avid sports gamer.   I play daily, always enjoy battling it out online (FIFA, NHL, what have you). Now since real sports have been out of action, my interest in gaming (I only play sports games) also coincidentally stopped. \n\nThis is where I put two and two together. Pre-covid, I would always fire up a couple games in the morning. It gets my competitive juices flowing. It focuses me. After my few games, I'm alert.  I'm sharp. Not to mention some confidence boost from crushing one of my online opponents :P. I'm ready to be productive and take this energy into my study sessions. \n\nNow because this was an unconscious routine I developed, I didn't even notice this was out of my life until my epiphany moment. Seeing how classes probably going to be online this coming fall (and god forbid into 2021), we gotta adapt and figure out our shit out. \n\n**Moral of the story:** if you struggled like me this summer, analyze your routines and habits. Is there some unconscious pre-covid habit that got you fired up and was subsequently was taken away without it consciously registering? And if you didn't have anything pre-covid, maybe think about finding something? Being productive isn't necessarily allowing yourself to only do \"productive\" things.",

It'd be free, one-to-one, and run by recent graduates. Could I maybe get some feedback on what you'd be looking for? We offer programs for social anxiety, procrastination, mild-moderate depression, and behavior change (e.g. improving study / diet / drinking / drug habits).",

        "post": "Hey guys!\n\nI hear from so many students on how they are able to take credits upon credits while having a full-time job or working multiple jobs and still end up with As.  I've had trouble holding jobs due to my anxiety, but I've managed to stick with this one for a couple of months. Last semester I attempted to take 13 credits while working but ended up dropping one of the classes (second level English) and was left with 9 credits. I ended up falling behind in my math class because we had a switch in professors in my other course and she was more demanding than the previous professor.\n\nI've taken 17 credits before but they were easy gen-ed classes, I wasn't working, and my discipline was much higher.\n\nCurrently I have 3 labs (physics, chem 2, o chem 1) and calculus I. Organic Chemistry seems like it will be very demanding, especially with my current prof. I have 16+ assignments/readings I have to do, and today is just the first day. I feel overwhelmed already! I don't know how much time I should be spending on my classes. I always end up spending too long on individual tasks  (like reading through a powerpoint) or on one class, and end up being more overwhelmed as I have less and less time and more and more to complete.\n\nMaybe I should also lower my expectations of getting an A in all my classes :/\n\nIt's probably not doing me good to be procrastinating by writing this right now.",

        "title": "Should I take a gap year for mental health if I will lose scholarship money?",
        "post": "I'm coming to Reddit mostly as a last resort because I've been deliberating over this for over a month and classes start in 2 weeks.  Here's the situation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*TLDR at the bottom!!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just finished my first semester of junior year in a city college. It's relatively low-cost compared to other colleges and I have no debt thus far because my mother is able to pay for it plus scholarship money I receive. I still rely on my family and live at home. I've been pretty aimless for my entire college experience. I have no clue about what I want to do with my life nor how to proceed other than drudging through the four years to my bachelors. I also have a history of depression and it's gotten a lot worst since I entered college. I developed full-blown social anxiety and I haven't been able to make any friends. I was incredibly lonely until I started volunteering/interning at a non-prof in the school for the past year, and it's the only reason my anxiety is better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a decent GPA but I'm a generally horrible student. I'm such a severe procrastinator that I'm in a constant state of stress and sleeplessness during the semester because of my lack of motivation. I'll just stay up all night not writing papers, then writing them or studying hours before their due date. This in itself is a problem I'm ashamed of because I should have grown out of it, but that's a different issue. It's both caused by and contributes to my depression (I assume).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn any case, this semester was especially bad. I overloaded myself with difficult classes and an internship and I completely burned out. I had to drop a major class I needed, and I gave in all my final papers late. I was so depressed over my personal performance, that my mom or my therapist first suggested that I could take a gap semester and work. As time went on, I decided that a break would be beneficial to my mental help, and my therapist thought so too. My mother was very supportive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n For the past three semesters, I've been receiving a scholarship that pays for my tuition. It's conditional, so if I don't meet 30 credits a year, I lose it. It was my main reason for not wanting to take a gap semester. How do you just take a break knowing it will cost you thousands of unnecessary dollars? I think my mom saw how distraught I was and ensured me over and over that she wouldn't mind if I lost the money if it would be good for me. The only reason I started to seriously consider taking off was because she was so supportive. It's her money she's spending on my education. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was a few months ago. Since I've gone on break (3 weeks ago), I've been forced to seriously consider what I want to do and find work for the break. I don't want to defend myself, but I literally haven't thought much about it because once I got out of school, I went completely into rest mode. I'm extremely avoidant and procrastinate, so I put it off. Everyone is telling me to do different things (get a job/go back to school/ go part time and get an internship/ get a full-time internship) and I have no idea what to do. I feel like every choice I make will be a mistake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this past week, I finally settled on taking 2 classes and finding an internship or work on the side, but even that is an undertaking. The thought of going back is scary. I hate school so much, and because of the way I am, it's made me miserable and isolated. I feel like I can barely function in class, and I can't do well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today, I finally tell my mom what I think I'm going to do during my gap, and she asks me (again, I've told her multiple times) what happens if I take a gap. I reiterated that I'd lose the scholarship and couldn't reapply. I think this made her nervous combined with my previous aimlessness. Against what she previously told me, she gently asks me if I want to just go back to class and take a gap later so I'll get another semester of paid tuition. She told me again that it was my choice, but asked me again if I really didn't want to go back. I didn't say anything, and she said that it felt like a waste to  lose free money and I'd sit at home depressed and jobless. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do. Obviously, my mom is justified in doing this. It's free money and she has to pay for tuition. But I did consider this. Actually, the only reason I didn't want to take a gap was *because* of the money, and I only decided to because of how many times she told me it was okay. It's been at least 2+ months. Now, 2 weeks before class, she's suddenly asking me if I want to go back and stick it out. It changes everything. I can't justify taking a gap knowing that she prefers I go back to class. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's just that I spent a long time thinking about this. I don't even have my classes prepared for full-time because I wasn't going back. And while she still says it's my choice, she has to know that it no longer is. Obviously her rationale is valid (and a little faithless). Why would she tell me so many times that it was fine if it wasn't, and wait until I'm ready to leave to tell me otherwise? Thinking of going back full time is freaking me out. I feel so sick. I will if I have to but I don't want to. I don't know what to do. I don't think my mental health is important enough to make her pay thousands of dollars if I can manage, but all the same, my head is really spinning now that my plans might be in the trash. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer idea of delaying taking a gap is also useless to me. After the upcoming semester, I would only need to stay for 1-2 more semesters to finish my degree, so I wouldn't even bother taking a break at that point. I wanted to leave after this semester because of my poor performance and depression. So if I go back, I'd be in it for the long haul.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt could be I'm not thinking rationally. I don't even know if anyone will read this. I would just like someone to tell me what they think, and any advice they may have. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Tldr; I get a scholarship that pays for my tuition. I'm supported by my mom. Because of worsening mental health and confusion over career path, my mom encouraged me to take a gap year 2+ months ago. I would lose the scholarship and can't reapply, but she reassured me mult. times that she supports my choice b/c the tuition is low cost. I started planning for my gap and was set on it. Today, 2 weeks before class, mom asks me to go back full time. Stressed and don't know what to do. It's her money, but my head.*",

        "post": "We don\u2019t talk about mental health issues enough. I had a relative who had clinical depression for over 30 years, and his symptoms include extreme emotions (super happy or supper sad or super angry or super fearful), insomnia, anxiety, and sometimes even hallucinations (he grab his passport and think he needs to run away somewhere to stay safe). I used to think that he\u2019s just a selfish, impatient, and ill-tempered person. But over the years I\u2019ve come to accept that a lot of this is due to his depression. Not everyone in the family has accepted it unfortunately, even though we all know he is diagnosed with depression. \n\nAnyway, I wrote a post regarding how to find mental health resources and what are the options out there, because a lot of people don\u2019t know where to find them apparently. I hope this will help many of you. It\u2019s important to figure out mental health issues early on (especially in college when you are away from family support). My relative has been on medication for decades. Can you imagine if he was not properly diagnosed??? :O Please let me know what you think or anything you think should be added to it. You can read it on the site [here](https://stellarlane.com/blog/mental-health-resources-in-college) or below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMental health in college students was at a crisis point even *before* the pandemic started. But COVID-19 has exacerbated the amount of stress, anxiety, depression, and other diagnosable mental illnesses in college students. Many students still don\u2019t know where to find mental health resources in college, though.\n\nKeep reading for:\n\n* a snapshot of mental health trends on college campuses, before and during COVID-19\n* college campus mental health services and how to find them\n* off-campus mental health resources\n* how and why to get disability accommodations for a mental illness\n* how to manage a mental illness in college\n\nUse these resources, and share this information with someone else who is struggling.\n\nBut before we go any further:\n\n## If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or need immediate support:\n\n* Call your school\u2019s counseling services center. The phone number can be found on your school\u2019s student affairs website.\n* Call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room if you are in danger of hurting yourself or others.\n* Call school police, who can escort you to counseling centers or the emergency room. Calling them won\u2019t get you into trouble, or anything negative. They are simply there to get you the help you need.\n* Contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255, or use Lifeline Chat (suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/) if you cannot call.\n* Text BRAVE to 741-741 to reach the National Alliance on Mental Illness crisis chat line.\n\n## Mental Health By the Numbers\n\nEven before the pandemic hit, college students' mental health was on the decline.\n\nIn 2019, studies conducted by the National Alliance on Mental Illness showed:\u00a0\n\n* 25% of students have been diagnosed or treated for a mental health condition in the past year (2018)\n* 35% of college students are struggling with mental health problems\n* 27% of college students in the US are diagnosed with depression\n* 11% of college students have been diagnosed with anxiety\n* 57.7% of college students confessed that they have felt \u201coverwhelming anxiety\u201d in the prior year\n* 50% of students admit to having suicidal thoughts\n* Only 9% of college students decide to seek professional help on campus\n* 73.1% of counseling center directors report a significant increase of severe mental health issues in college students\n\nThese statistics show the upward trend of mental illness in colleges, but don\u2019t reflect how COVID-19 has shifted the mental health outlook.\n\n## How has COVID-19 affected college students' mental health and wellbeing?\n\nAccording to Active Minds, a nonprofit dedicated to spreading mental health awareness and advocacy efforts, conducts biannual surveys measuring the state of mental health in college students.\n\nAfter surveying 2086 college students about the effect of COVID-19 on mental health in April 2020, they found the following:\n\n* 1 in 5 college students say their mental health has *significantly* worsened due to COVID-19\n* 80% of college students say COVID-19 has negatively impacted their mental health\n* 55% of college students would not know where to go if they or someone they knew needed mental health services right away\n\n## On-Campus Mental Health Resources: What\u2019s available?\n\nMany campuses will host students on campus and provide regular services again as everyone continues to get the vaccines available. But the delivery of mental health resources may vary, with many campuses offering telehealth services in addition to, or instead of, in-person appointments.\n\nIn general, though, most college campuses offer these mental health services:\n\n* consultations on academic issues or personal stressors\n* drop-in hours for students who really need to work through high stress or crisis situations\n* short-term individual therapy\n* group therapy (usually lasting six to eight weeks, or throughout the semester)\n* psychiatric care (on a case-by-case basis)\n* assistance with finding more permanent treatment providers (this service is known as care coordination)\n* coping skills workshops (to manage anxiety, stress, feelings of depression, etc.)\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what all your campus has to offer, use this campus mental health service search tool to find out (ulifeline.org/get\\_help\\_now).\n\n## How to Access On-Campus Mental Health Services\n\n## Drop-In Student Mental Health Services\n\nIf your campus has drop-in mental health services, then you don\u2019t need to schedule an appointment. All you have to do is walk into (or call) your campus wellness center during designated drop-in hours and ask to speak to someone about whatever\u2019s on your mind.\u00a0\n\nJust make sure to check your school\u2019s website to find out whether to physically go or call campus mental health services \u2014 social distancing policies are changing constantly.\u00a0\n\nSchools may also continue to offer telehealth services after COVID-19, so you could still have that option, if it\u2019s more convenient for you.\n\nUse drop-in mental health services when you:\n\n* are in a mental health crisis\n* need short term support as you work through distressing emotions\n* need help making a big decision (like whether to drop a class or move back home)\n\nOnce you are connected with a counseling professional, they will usually talk you through your situation and teach you some coping skills to handle distress in the future.\u00a0\n\nThey will talk to you for however long you need, but drop-in sessions usually last around an hour at most.\n\nThey may schedule an appointment to speak with you again, but usually drop-in appointments are one-and-done.\n\n## Therapy for College Students\n\nIf you have been experiencing intense sadness, nervousness, insomnia, anxiety, depression, irregular eating or exercise habits, or any other problems you would like long-term help with, you will have to schedule an intake appointment with a counseling professional to talk about getting more help.\n\nYou can find out how to schedule an appointment on your school\u2019s student affairs webpage. They will most likely require you to fill out some forms before your appointment. These usually include questions about your concerns and any previous mental/physical health problems you have faced.\n\nThey may ask you for insurance information. **If you don\u2019t have insurance, still schedule the campus intake appointment** and talk to your school about your options.\n\nDuring your appointment, you and a trained professional will decide how to meet your individual needs.\n\nYou may receive short-term individual therapy with someone on campus. Usually, counselors work with students for three to eight sessions to process short-term stressors.\u00a0\n\nYou may also be directed towards group therapy, which usually lasts 6-8 weeks. Groups may specialize in anxiety support, emotion management, substance use, graduate student issues, etc. These will vary by institution.\n\nHowever, if you need more long-term care, campus counselors may connect you to mental health professionals in your community. Counseling centers do this to keep clinicians available for other students who need them.\n\nYour counselor will draw up a list of providers in the community that accept your insurance (if you have any.) They will also help you email, call, and follow up if you are afraid to make the call, or forget to.\n\n## Psychiatric Services\n\nSome campuses have licensed psychiatrists available to prescribe medications for students who require them.\n\nIf you are not already taking medications to manage a mental illness, you may be able to set up an appointment with a campus psychiatrist.\n\nBut you may have to wait a while before you can get an appointment, as campus psychiatrists are in relatively high demand.\n\nCampus psychiatrists will most likely assist you in finding someone in the community to help you manage new medications.\n\n## Off-Campus Mental Health Resources for College Students\n\nWhen it comes to getting help, you aren\u2019t limited to what your campus can offer. You\u2019re also not limited to traditional mental health services.\n\n## Individual Services\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have a referral from someone on campus to meet with a professional in your area.\u00a0\n\nSearch for therapists, psychiatrists, treatment centers, and support groups using Psychology Today or Mental Health Match.\n\nYou can filter results by specialization, availability, gender, religion, sexuality, and treatment practice to find someone who:\u00a0\n\n* has experience treating your personal issues and/or mental illness\n* you are comfortable being around (e.g. a woman may prefer to have a woman for a therapist)\n* understands your values (e.g. your religion or philosophy)\n* has availability at the time you need it\n\nConsider your academic and biological schedule when you make your first appointment: are you able to consistently wake up in the morning? Are you sure you will always be available at the time you schedule your sessions for?\n\nMissed appointments don\u2019t usually get covered by insurance, and many professionals have a late fee, cancellation policy, etc. Be mindful of this when you schedule that first appointment.\n\n## Online Support Groups\n\nOnline support groups are widely available now, in part because of COVID-19. They offer access to support for people who usually can\u2019t afford to travel or pay for traditional therapy.\n\nThis is an extensive list of online support groups (mhanational.org/find-support-groups) from Mental Health America.\n\n## Self Care and Coping Skills Resources\n\nSelf care is any activity that you intentionally do to take care of your mental, physical, and/or emotional health. Practicing self care will help you manage your stress and calm yourself down when you need to.\n\nIt\u2019s not a replacement for professional help. But it can really improve your wellbeing if you incorporate self care into your routine.\n\nThis can be anything from a gentle walk, to doing something creative, to calling a friend just to talk.\n\nSelf care is not staying up late watching something on Netflix. It\u2019s more intentional and restorative than that.\n\n## COVID-19 Mental Health Resources\n\nThere are so many resources out there for students affected by COVID-19.\n\nThe Jed Foundation, which was founded by parents who lost their son to suicide, is dedicated to raising mental health awareness, suicide prevention, and providing mental health resources to young adults, especially college students.\n\nThey have provided a massive COVID-19 resource guide to help students cope throughout the pandemic.\n\nEven as things get back to normal, the coping skills you learn during a crisis like COVID-19 can be used for the rest of your life.\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019re going to be stressed over lots of things, so the skills never become irrelevant.\n\n## How to Manage Mental Illness While in College\n\n## Be proud of yourself.\n\nYou are handling school and your mental health, at the same time, and that\u2019s impressive! You\u2019re doing great things and you really should be proud of yourself.\n\n## Leave any embarrassment behind.\n\nIf you think you\u2019re the only student on campus struggling with mental illness, you\u2019re so wrong. 20% of college students have a diagnosable mental illness, remember?\n\nIt\u2019s normal to struggle, normal to ask for help, *and* normal to take medication for an illness. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nSo try as hard as you can to leave any shame or embarrassment you feel about your mental illness in the past.\n\n## Consider disability accommodations.\n\nWhile you absolutely can succeed in school with a mental illness, you probably need different things than your peers to reach that success.\n\nYour school (and the federal government) understands this, which is why disability accommodations exist. There are physical and mental disability accommodations available at every learning institution.\n\nMental health accommodations include, but are not limited to:\n\n* testing at an alternate location to minimize distractions\n* extra time to test, which helps minimize anxiety\n* an extended number of absences (within reason)\n* access to peer notes or audio recordings of notes\n* more time to complete assignments (within reason)\n* assistance with assignments and scheduling during hospitalization\n\nThese do not all apply in the remote learning setting, of course. Testing conditions, especially, have changed in the remote learning setting, for obvious reasons.\n\nStudents usually request and use accommodations if they are having trouble focusing, adjusting to new medications, or managing symptoms of a disorder (such as fatigue or insomnia.)\n\nStart by looking up your school\u2019s disability services department information. You will probably have to schedule an intake appointment with someone from the disability services department.\u00a0\n\nBefore your appointment, you will need to provide documentation of your disability, including:\n\n* the name of the professional who diagnosed you\n* any medications you are currently on\n* symptoms you are experiencing\n* prior hospitalizations due to your illness\n\nAt your appointment, they will ask what accommodations you think you need.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s probably not a great idea to go in and ask to never have to attend class or to be able to turn in any assignment late without discussing it with a professor first.\n\nBe reasonable with your requests.\u00a0\n\nYou will probably have a meeting with someone from disability resources every semester, so you can reevaluate accommodations as needed.\n\nIf you get accommodations for your disability, you do have to disclose the fact that you have a disability to any professor whose class you wish to use your accommodations in. The disclosure process is regulated by disability services.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you have a calculus class that tests.\u00a0\n\nYou have test anxiety, which is why you have testing accommodations like extra time and testing in a private room.\n\nIf you want to use your accommodations in this class, you have to tell them that you have a disability, and the accommodation, *but* you don\u2019t have to tell them that you have test anxiety.\n\nYou will most likely have an online account with disability services, where you can choose which professors and TAs to send disability/accommodation disclosure documents to.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n## Create an open line of communication with your professors and TAs.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to tell any professor anything specific about your mental illness.\n\nBut it can be helpful to tell them about any symptoms you may be experiencing, any problems you foresee in the future, and anything they can do to help.\n\nFor example, if you know that your depression gets worse in the winter, let your professors know ahead of time that you may have some difficulty getting to class on time or finishing assignments promptly.\n\nProfessors and TAs know how stressful college is, and if you don\u2019t use your illness a san excuse to procrastinate, then they will sympathize with you.\n\n## Manage medications (if you take any.)\n\nCollege is generally a little hectic and you\u2019ve probably got a lot going on right now.\n\nBut if you take medications for a mental illness, then making sure you get the right dose at the right time is your first priority, always.\n\nSet timers to remind yourself to take medications, pick up scripts, and go to appointments.\u00a0\n\nAsk roommates and parents to help you remember, if you need someone else to remind you.\n\n## Stick to a routine (seriously, it helps.)\n\nYou've heard it before, several times \u2014 eat, sleep, drink water, and study at regular intervals, and your life will really improve.\n\nBy now it almost sounds clich\u00e9, but a balanced routine (or as balanced as possible) can change your life.\n\nJust getting up in the morning and having a filling breakfast can make all the difference in your day.\u00a0\n\n## Get extra help with your courses when you need it.\n\nIf you notice that you\u2019re slipping up because you missed class or couldn\u2019t focus, take action now.\n\nGet a classmate or hire an affordable online tutor to work with you 1-on-1 in whatever subject you\u2019re struggling with.\u00a0\n\nMake sure to play catch up as soon as you notice you\u2019re slipping, so you don\u2019t fall even more behind.\n\n## Practice self-compassion.\n\nYou face different challenges than many of your peers. Even other people with the same mental illness struggle in unique ways.\n\nSo you\u2019re not all going to succeed on the same level and at the same pace.\n\nYou may not get fantastic grades if you have anxiety flare ups. You may not be very present in class if you\u2019re adjusting to new bipolar medication. You may have to take a semester off to get treatment for an eating disorder.\n\nAcknowledge the struggle, and be proud that you showed up to school in spite of it.\u00a0\n\nAnd know that you will succeed if you continue working on your mental health.\n\n## You can succeed, even if you\u2019re struggling right now.\n\nThousands of people with mental illness graduated last year. Thousands of students will do it this year.\n\nUse these mental health resources to take care of yourself, and you can be another person who graduates in spite of all the challenges that come with mental illness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo see my post with links to resources, you can visit my site [here](https://stellarlane.com/blog/mental-health-resources-in-college).",

When I was in college I lived for the pressure of the 11:59 p.m. Sunday deadline (or others.)

Perhaps it was my depression at times; maybe it was my confidence in myself at others.\n\nAt the start of each semester, I would look at my class schedule and think, \"I'm gonna fail X class so badly.\" Usually, I would ace it or get a B. But one thing that always helped me get through school was not pressuring myself to do things right off the bat and not overanalyzing the assignments and course topics until I drove myself insane. I had to be in the mood to do it.\n\nI probably could have graduated with a MUCH higher GPA if I would not have waited so late to do assignments but there was a thrill to my madness. When the student in me clicked, it really clicked and it was like a euphoric trance.\n\nI've talked to many of my peers when I was in college about this and they kind of felt the same.

There's no time schedule, somedays I'll just wake up at random hours and start doing homework. I can't stay organized and my thoughts are going at 100 miles an hour, some are even repetitive and it's hard to focus on my work. I'm not on Adderall or any medication. This just all feels like pure energy or something, it's like I can't stop. It feels like I can't take a break or I'll get all panicked. I'm sorry if I don't make sense, it's hard to make sense right now. Just want help managing my time please.\n\nEdit: I want to add that I've been feeling paranoid as well, another factor as to why I can't sleep on top of the energry. Like I said no drugs, this just naturally happens. It's either this or I fall behind on everything and become a depressed mess due to the guilt of procrastination.

I\u2019m usually a pretty good student but lately it\u2019s been different. Forgetting assignments or not doing them at all, blowing off things till the last hour, just overall lazy and procrastinating and it\u2019s made me feel awful and I have tried but I can\u2019t get out of what\u2019s going on. Am I the only one?\n\nEdit: I wanted to add in that I don\u2019t mean to make a sob story for myself, just feels like a place I can post smtn like this and have peers relate to it.\n\nEdit 2: Wow! Didn\u2019t expect this to blow up, so happy to see everyone sharing their stories about this semester. Thanks for the support and thank you guys for supporting each other through all of this!

I\u2019m sure a lot of you do the same, it\u2019s easy when your schedule is packed with classes and a job. It\u2019s an awful habit and I feel it makes me miss the point of assignments, but I get good grades. I\u2019m not some genius who knows everything about everything, I\u2019m just really good at bullshitting. Give me a random topic for a given class and I\u2019ll have a full essay done the next day, with sources that work. \n\nLast Monday night, I started a presentation, essay, exam, and small homework assignment due the next morning. Exam went well, smaller homework assignment went well. Essay and presentation were over the same topic, I was to present Tuesday morning. I ended up feeling really sick before class (likely food poisoning), so I wasn\u2019t able to give the presentation. But I submitted the essay. It\u2019s not my finest work, but I got it done. I didn\u2019t expect much from it, I was just hoping my grade would be fine. I got it back and I got a B+. Main problem was that I didn\u2019t use in-text citations enough. \n\nI want to stop procrastinating so I can actually develop assignments and take something away from them other than a grade. But it\u2019s hard when time and time again this method works. My friends spend hours a week working on assignments due a month in advance, and I\u2019m doing the same if not better than they are. They\u2019re learning the material and I\u2019m not. But I can\u2019t get myself to start earlier. It\u2019s whatever I guess. As long as I pass, it\u2019s fine.

I am so far a 3.85 UW gpa students who took 10+ AP classes in my hs career. Senior year, however, Ive been so overwhelmed and lazy that I just avoid studying AND doing my homework WHICH IN TURN makes me have to relearn everything the day before a quiz or test WHICH then freaks me out. I avoid studying now because I am so done with feeling like crap when I cram. And before you say \"just do your hw\" it's not that easy! \n\nSchool this year has been like a tumbleweed. The ball keeps getting picked up by the wind, getting bigger and bigger till its so big nobody can pick it up. I have to do my hw but then I have to study for my AP quizzes and test which makes me postpone my hw to study which leaves be heavily behind in my other class and the cycle continues till every class I am behind on everything. I dont even have time to ask teachers questions, leaving questions unaswered for tests and quizzes. I had my AP tests this week (typically I score a 4 or 5), but I feel so overwhelmed with all the coursework I have to RELEARN throughout the year, that I just dont have the energy to sit there and start from scratch.\n\nMy organization skills are a mess too. I dont know where anything is anymore and my notes seem to have... disappeared lol.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n\\- How do I stay organized with my notes and stop losing stuff. I have binders and folders and I have tried numerous methods throughout the years, but it always end the same: a mess at the end of the semester\n\n\\- How to fix my current issue with classes and I am going to make huge efforts in college to get a 3.9-4.0. Only way I can do it if I can fix these problems.",

Once I hit junior year though, my level of motivation began its decline. And now, as a junior in college, I would be surprised if it is not at rock bottom yet.\n\nI cannot for the life of me bring myself to do any given assignment, no matter how easy it is. It feels like there\u2019s a barrier in my brain with bliss, happiness and joy on the other side that I can\u2019t get by until I face it, but I\u2019m too intimidated to, so I just dilly-dally with meaningless shit that is not going to get me very far in life instead.

It helps a lot in terms of lifting my mood and getting me up and going, only, it\u2019s towards the wrong stuff. It affects me the way it does most people, only when it kicks me into gear, I apply myself to the wrong things (basically anything that isn\u2019t schoolwork) most likely because, no matter what, the only thing that can motivate me to get my priorities done is myself.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what someone whose motivated to get their work done, even if they have to force themselves\u2019, thought process is; hence why I\u2019m not only writing this post right now but making it as long as it is, as if I\u2019m trying to reach the word count of an essay.

        "post": "Fellow students,\n\nI know it's so easy to procrastinate, to push your work aside and cram in the very last minute. You tell yourself that you'll work on it after watching an episode of your show, or after taking a nap because you're too exhausted to start this assignment. After hours of putting off your work, you finally decide to open your laptop and start. You click on the assignment and 5 minutes later you find yourself on your phone, distracted once again. \n\nI just wanted to remind you that you are completely capable of acing your classes, of earning the grades you'll be happy with. All it takes is a conscious effort to complete your assignments and set aside time for your studies. \n\nProcrastination stems from fear, and the key is to do your work despite *feeling* like you want to procrastinate. There is no physical barrier between you and your assignments, it's all mental. So, ground yourself, stop the self sabotaging, and get it done. You\u2019ll feel awesome and accomplished and still have time to do everything else you like. Nothing is above you, nothing is too difficult for you, and you are more than capable of being *that* student.\n\nEdit: The intent behind this post wasn\u2019t to completely change lives, to sound cheery, to oversimplify a bigger problem or to sell something. It\u2019s a short post and I personally love coming across things like this because it makes me feel not so alone with these struggles. I know the internet is saturated with fake positivity these days. You are free to take it or leave it. On the other hand, I\u2019m so glad many of you could relate and found this motivating. I often journal stuff like this but I wanted to share it today because I thought it might resonate with people.",

For example, last night I stayed up until 6 am procrastinating and knowing I should write a short essay. I slept 4~ hours, and when I had 2 hours left before class/deadline, I wrote the essay in less than an hour. \n\nSo far I haven't fallen off the wagon and my marks have been okay, I'm pretty happy with them. But I can't keep doing this. So I would appreciate some tips. ",

It's almost like a high for crying out loud, it makes me HAPPY to do work. but because of how much time I wasted, I'll turn in an assignment late and feel like absolute crap, promise to change, and then don't. I've tried to find new techniques, like the Pomodoro, or writing down everything I need to do in a list and then completing it. But for some god-forsaken reason, I always stoop back down to this risky as hell work style, and I pay the price for it every. damn. semester. I want to change, I really god-damned do, but I think I need advice that targets my motivation issues over my time management ones. Perhaps I'm just venting at this point.

My mom has a good job that's unrelated to her degree (she's an accountant for an insurance company with a law degree) and my step dad never went to college and yet they got a pretty decent job and we live pretty comfortably, they just worked hard and pleased the right people. I think I want to do that. I'm a pretty ethical person who does what they're told but I'm scared of being taken advantage of, but at the same time, I feel the same thing will happen if I sign up for college.\n\nEven though I'm good at school, I see no purpose in attending college but I just don't want to disappoint people and be a waste.",

So bored and lonely to shit to the point where I have solved my problem of procrastination. Instead of delaying all work to the last minute, legit all I want to do now is whatever homework, project, or reading is assigned so I can distract myself. \n\nI don't know if I have social anxiety or something, I just can't bring myself to talk with people, even people that I would consider I am vaguely acquainted with. Only people I feel comfortable around are people from high school, but they live on the other side of campus. I feel like everyone else has already established their group of people, and I'm on the extreme periphery that only occasionally hitches along. Literally known as \"\\_\\_\\_\\_'s roommate\" with people that I've talked to more than once.\n\nI eat alone every single day, and I hate it so much that I only eat a meal a day, and some days I legit just skip eating entirely. There are many days where I very literally don't speak a single word. My roommate and I are like, I guess friendly, but we legit don't talk to each other. Just pure silence in room.\n\nCS major so there are just a ton of extreme nerds, even more than me, Indian/Chinese internationals, and other generally socially incompetent people like me that I have a hard time relating or talking with. \n\nI just feel to fucking old to interact with other freshmen. Part of the too old thing is that I'm a relatively \"high-performing\" student. All of my friends in high school were like this and I guess that's part of the reason why we were friends. They all went to T20s. I go to state school. Its not like, bad academically for CS or anything, but the school still has a somewhat lower academic bar for admission. It is also a party school. All of this adds up to where I just can't relate or talk to anyone else I feel. Have met a handful of people like the friends I had in high school but still don't talk to them a lot.\n\nNever felt anything like this before, I was always somewhat shy but it was never this bad in high school and like I felt at least a bit more outgoing towards senior year. I think about transferring every single day or how to graduate in 2 years to get me out sooner. What the fuck do I do?",

I have a bottle of caffeine pills, a bag of apples, 2 huge bottles of water, and an open window to keep the temperature in the room at an uncomfortably low temperature. I will update as the night wears on. It's currently 2:38 A.M. where I am.\n\nEDIT 1: I'm about half way through my paper. I hope to have it finished by 6.\nEDIT 2: Thanks for the encouragement everyone. Everything turned out really well. ",

        "post": "This is my first Reddit post, so, um... yay?\n\nI was always a really good student in high school. I studied. I got everything done. I was one of the top students of my 180-something student class, and I was proud of it. I always felt really good about (most) of my assignments. It was a lot of hard work, but I was confident in what I did.\n\nBut it's just been really different in college. I've been procrastinating so much. I've had very little motivation and inspiration to do my assignments, and by the time I do, I'm a bit of an anxious mess trying to make sure it's done well and submitted on time. There have been many a midnight shower due to how late I've been doing my homework. I've been getting good grades, but it feels like my work doesn't deserve it. \n\nI think one of the reasons why I haven't really been motivated to do my assignments right away is cuz I feel like whatever I do isn't going to be good enough for the professors. Like it somehow won't fit the very vague guidelines they assigned, so I shouldn't even bother trying because it feels like they're going to read my paper and laugh anyway. I really wish it didn't feel like this. I used to feel so confident about my schoolwork, especially my writing. It might just be a normal feeling in college, having the transition from the structure of high school to having chill professors, but not having such a clear-cut rubric makes me worried I'm not doing the assignment correctly. It makes me not even want to start it because it feels like I'll fail every time I try.\n\nIt's been five weeks since I moved in, and I still don't have any friends. I'm wondering if that's a part of it as well. Like, if every attempt I've made to try to make friends have failed, there's no way I'll be able to impress my professors. I dunno. I guess I'm just making this long so I don't have to work on my paper.\n\nAny advice about how to stop procrastinating and how to feel more confident about academics would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time. Sorry of this was too much to read.",

Luckily they accepted, and allowed me to have financial aid on a term by term basis if I met the requirements of an academic plan that was made for me. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t quite meet the requirements, so my financial aid was suspended. I was given the option of filing another appeal that would only be accepted if I experienced mitigating circumstance. However, I didn\u2019t experience a loss or sickness. I was just struggling mentally and procrastinating. My therapist said she would be willing to write a letter on my behalf. And a financial aid officer at my school said I should try turning it in. But the new semester starts in a week, and I don\u2019t want to run the risk of it being denied and not being able to pay for classes. I honestly feel like, I should sit this semester out or something. Not sure what to do??",

But I also think it is because I am highly introverted and never had any friends in any of my classes so I just paid attention and understood things during class. \n\nFor college, I wanted to be fully online for various reasons. As a serious procrastinator, this is terrible. I still manage to hand in all my work and I usually hand in most of my work quite easily because it is mostly mindless assignments that are straightforward. \n\nBut this one class is business communication. This class makes me want to throw up. I despise the words. I cannot write for the life of me anymore. I used to be able to write assignments fine in high school. Now I'm sitting here currently trying to write a business report due tomorrow with barely a page worth written. \n\nI am having so much of a mental block trying to write this that I am feeling sick in my stomach, I feel like throwing up, and I am getting very frustrated with myself. I want to do anything but write this thing. \n\nIt is also literally the last assignment of the semester and I just cannot do it. No matter how long I sit in front of my computer nothing is coming to mind. I just want to be over with this thing to the point where I am considering handing in what I've written so far and this very poor quality for the percentage this assignment is worth. \n\nI feel so stuck. I tried asking my family for help, but they are not super interested in this, especially with how much I procrastinated in high school. It kinda feels like I am the boy who cried wolf. I do not know what to do about this. I feel trapped. \n\nI just needed to say this out loud.",

        "post": "TL;DR (I do still recommend reading it, or saving it for later): focus on getting started rather than the work you have to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI assume you've all had trouble getting out of bed in the morning, or opening your book to do revision, or even doing your chores at some point. So have I. I'm ***not*** a hugely productive person, I still procrastinate and refuse to do my work because [scrolling Instagram](https://media.giphy.com/media/63I6FXZTXks2A/giphy.gif) or sleeping is much easier, however I often have days where I can get 10+ hours of work done (or 5+ hours if it's a school day). I ***do not*** have great self control half of the time, if I pick my phone up I'll often lose 2-3 hours because I get carried away. However, this time I've decided to use those hours to write something useful for others instead of looking at posts on Instagram that won't make my day any more productive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sure there's a name for this method of getting work done, since ***I didn't come up with it myself*** but rather read about it somewhere that I can't remember anymore. In it's core, it's about turning your long task into a shorter one. I don't mean cutting corners and taking shortcuts, but focusing on the ***start*** of it. Rather than thinking \"I need to get 1 hour of revision done, I'm really not bothered, I'll do it tomorrow\", try to think of it as \"I need to open my textbook, that's it, I'm only going to open my textbook, I'll not do anything more than that\". Once you are there, with your textbook open, you will only naturally think to yourself \"I'm already here, why not get some work done then? What topic should I do first from the topic list that I'm conveniently looking at right now?\" and the rest is history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said in the title, this isn't limited to revision. Instead of \"I need to get up from bed for my very long day today, I'll be late if I don't get up soon\", turn it into \"I need to get up and look out of the window to check if it's raining\" or \"I need to get my socks on\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't think of your task as the big picture or focus on the process of it, just try to get it started. Just like a car for (a weird) comparison, it's much easier to keep yourself rolling once you're in motion than it is to get moving from scratch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope I helped some of you, maybe it won't work as well for you as it does for me, but at least give it a shot, worst case scenario you'll be where you started.",

        "post": "I just don't understand how people do well in college and can maintain good study habits all the time. Like, there's so many \"haha yeah I'm a procrastinator\" type of people, but then there's people who habitually procrastinate to the point that it starts to become a serious problem, and I'm increasingly falling into the second group.\n\nI never learned how to study in high school. I took APs and did a couple extracurriculars all that jazz, but it never really taught me proper time management nor did it teach me any study skills at all. It felt like I just skated by and did nothing in my high school classes for 4 years and was depressed & anxious as fuck the whole time, and then graduated.\n\nI didn't learn how to study in my freshman year of college, either. I had to drop a few classes in the fall that I couldn't handle and was a part-time student, but did fine in the classes that I stayed enrolled in. I was full-time in the spring and managed to get pretty decent grades but it felt like I was doing the bare minimum in terms of effort on my own part.\n\nNor did I learn how to study this summer; I'm taking two classes and working part-time, and the actual content of the classes I'm in are starting to get more serious and major-specific, and I still don't know how to study, and I'm starting to face actual consequences for it--I'm going to fail one of my classes out of sheer negligence and inability to figure out how to study and dedicate time to class. I'll pass my other class, but this is gonna leave a mark.\n\nI'm not even a party-er--I've been to maybe one party in the past two months, and I didn't go to many during the regular academic year, maybe like 3 a semester. I don't have personal access to alcohol or weed either so I can't use those except when friends have them, which isn't very frequent either, maybe 2-3 times a month at most. What I do with a lot of my free time is just waste time on the internet--lots of snapchat, reddit, discord, instagram, etc--or listening to music, or just hanging out with people and not being able to get my stuff done because I'm distracted by being around other people. I'm very much an extrovert (I used to think I was an introvert but that's besides the point) so I kind of need to be around other people pretty frequently to stay sane, buuuut I really can't do work around other people for the most part. Another kind of dumb hobby of mine is wasting hours upon hours making ambitious 4-year degree plans, while avoiding doing work for exactly the classes that I need to actually get through my plan.\n\nI didn't have a job last school year, except for a research lab gig for about a month of my spring semester that ended up being a terrible fit for me and I quit. I have a 20 hrs/wk food service job this summer which I enjoy a lot but doesn't leave me any downtime to study or anything while I'm at work. I'm set to be working 10 hrs/wk there in the fall, and probably won't try to get a research position at all until at least next spring.\n\nI'm taking two pretty intense classes in the fall that are core to two majors I'm deciding between, plus another intense gen ed class, plus two other classes. I'm worried that my inability to keep my shit together is going to catch up to me and I'm going to mess up, and i'm gonna mess up BAD.\n\nWhat do I do? What skills do I need to learn? How do I muster up the willpower to actually do those things? How do I fix my time management and actually do well and get something out of my time & money that I'm spending here?",

        "post": "Hello guys. I'm going to my 2nd year in college and I want to share some tips and habits that I find useful and might help especially the ones who are going to their 1st year and are scared or stressed about college.\n\nWarning: I'm portuguese and I'm studying History in Portugal so this is >my< experience. I don't know how things work everywhere but I think some things apply to every student.\n\nFIND A PLACE (if not going to a college dorm):\n- start searching as early as possible. Search on renting websites, facebook groups, etc.\n- don't choose the cheapest one at first. If possible, define a gap of prices you can pay and make that your starting point. \n- visit the places before moving there. Sometimes it looks nice in the pictures but then you go there and discover that it's a bad place. So visit the house and ask about everything you find important.\n\nFOOD AND PREPARING MEALS:\n- don't buy processed food all the time. Yes, you will have time to prepare healthier meals if you put some effort on that.\n- if you don't want to cook everyday, save 3 or 4 hours a week to cook for a few days. You can prepare soup, pasta, rice, meat, fish, whatever you want and save it in the fridge. \n- salads are the master key. You need 10 minutes to prepare a salad with a lot of different ingredients. It's healthy, quick and easy to prepare and delicious.\n\nSTUDY:\n- stop studying in your bed, you will start feeling lazy and procrastinate your studying.\n- your computer (or iPad) will be your best friend. I also take mine to my classes and write everything the teacher says. That way I know there won't be any important information missing.\n- study at least 1 hour a day. Even though you don't have assignments, just study. There will be always some article or book to read and it's important to keep everything fresh in your head.\n- stop memorizing things. You need to learn and not memorize and forget about it one week later.\n- try different study methods (my favorite is to read out loud what I write like I'm the teacher explaining the subject to the students)\n- start reading things about your subjects early. Find books and articles about each subject and start trying to understand the easiest parts.\n- colors. Highlight the key words of your summary, it will be easier to study than just reading something written in only one color.\n\nSAVE MONEY:\n- food: buy things that are going to the trash in those apps/stores to save food. It's cheaper and good in general. Don't order food or go to restaurants all the time. \n- books: a kindle might be a good option but you can also download free books and read them on your computer or phone. If you really want paper books, you can search in second hand stores.\n- you don't need to go out every week or atleast you can look to free parties or activities. You can also search for places that have discounts for students and order youth cards that give you discounts in a lot of places.\n\nThose are some tips I find useful and important to keep an healthy routine while you're in college but it would be nice to see other people's opinion. :)",

        "post": "I lived in the same small town in the same house my entire life. I rarely got the opportunity to travel and it was mostly with family/to go see family. My family and I are very close.\n\nI went a little crazy my senior year of high school with drugs and alcohol, but for one of the first times I was happy and had good friends and I had been dating an awesome guy for a couple years. Parents found out. I was grounded, lost everything, including my boyfriend. During that time I abused prescription drugs and committed to a school five hours away because of the scholarships and its excellence in my major, as well as the distance between it and all of the bad things that had transpired in the past year and before that.\n\nAfter my 18th birthday I get back together with the boyfriend and regain some of my freedoms and old friends.\n\nNow, fast forward a year from that and I am almooost done with my first year of college. And I'm struggling. I have made two friends while I've been here that remain my friends currently. My roommate and I came in as close high school friends and were close until she began dating a guy here several months ago. Since then we've grown apart as they spend a lot of time together and she's made a couple new friends. (I also find myself wanting to be jealous of/mad at her for having a boyfriend she sees everyday, but I know that I shouldn't and I try not to be negative.)\n\nI rarely see my boyfriend and I love him so much. I know, we're young, I don't know what I'm talking about, but I do see a future and that's why we're staying together, even as long distance. It's easier for him, though. He has a circle of 10-12 friends with amazing personalities and they're all together constantly. Plus he has two jobs. We hardly even get to talk - just in the afternoon in between his jobs and at night when he gets off for an hour at most. We talk on the phone a couple times a week, the rest is messages.\n\nAnd I just miss my family. I was so ready to be on my own and away from them, but I miss the closeness and the reliability. Sometimes I call my mom and just cry on the phone. She's almost driven to come get me and let me skip class that week but I just can't afford to fuck up my schooling over this.\n\nThis also frustrates me because I wanted to travel and see the world. I wanted to make a career in big cities and make cultured friends and be fun. But all I am is a sobbing girl in her dorm room eating a lot of junk food and watching movies alone. And I feel like I truly do still have a lot of potential.\n\nWhen I'm on breaks at my parent's house or my boyfriend's I am extremely happy. But it always ends quickly. Once when it was time to leave his house I couldn't even do it and missed a whole day of class because I couldn't stop crying and he just had to let me stay there.\n\nI am here for free and it's the best school in our state for what I'm interested in. My boyfriend is back home at the best school for his major and his GPA is too low to transfer right now anyway. Despite my emotional distress I cannot justify either one of us giving up what we have.\n\nBut it's getting tough. My homework and studying is backed up because I keep missing class sleeping in and staying too long at my boyfriend's. I can scrape through the semester and save my GPA, but it'll be stressful the next six weeks. I cry a lot, sometimes over nothing. I found a letter my mom had written me and cried. My laundry smelled like my boyfriend's cologne and I cried. I saw my roommate's photos with her new friends on Facebook and cried. I've been losing weight and gaining it back, about ten pounds. I can't sleep at night. I've been getting sick often. I get migraines. I've been abusing prescription drugs, and the other day I took too much and spent all of my classes and work afterwards throwing up. I just feel very sad and defeated. I am not the brave, adventurous person I thought I was and I seem unable to do simple things everyone else is capable of. \n\nI felt like this on and off last semester and for the entirety of this semester (except spring break spent at home, I was happy then) - so about three consecutive months now. I am not suicidal, just deeply unhappy; though I do realize some of my actions are self-destructive. Getting through each day is just a checklist of things I have to do before I can call everybody at home that night. I feel like I'm not really living at all, and the further I get into this pit the harder it is to speak to people and smile and work hard and be a functioning person.\n\nI've tried keeping myself busy. Full courseload, full-time job, an extracurricular relating to my major that takes about 10 hours a week. But I still find hours of boredom and procrastination and loneliness. \n\nHas anyone had a similar experience? Advice? Anything? I'm trying to set up an appointment with our campus counselor, but I'm a little scared. Advice on talking to counselors is welcome as well, as I never have before.\n\n**TL;DR:** I would like advice on how to deal with extreme homesickness and depression and hear stories of what you faced and how it turned out.",

        "post": "I should've known it was coming. I am so stuck, and beyond knowing what to do. \n\nSince the second semester of 10th grade, I have been depressed. I had spent about a year and a half obsessed with overachieving, eager to perform well, terrified of not living up to my father's expectations - and it had led me to a bunch of self-destructive study habits, that I didn't realize was harmful because it worked. Because I was GOOD at school, I was great at drawing, I was great at essays, I was lazy, but still determined and managed to get around to getting what I wanted out of myself. This is starting to sound like a very typical 'gifted' kid situation. But I really was good at a lot of things.\n\nI have this vivid memory of the first time I realized my body was *tired*. I had a deadline coming up for one of my classes, it was the night before, and I remember sitting in my chair, realizing that I wasn't stressed. That last-minute surge of energy I used to get hours before a deadline, that stress that I used to rely on, it didn't come. It was only after the deadline had passed, that my body sprang into action.\n\nBut I was lucky back then. The tenth grade and the years following. Granted countless extensions, had understanding and generous teachers - and at the end of the day, even if it was as if I had no stress or motivation left in my body, I would still get it done at some point. I didn't realize though, that even though I got through those assignments, it had made me insanely ashamed. I spent my eleventh grade suicidal because of how much I hated my brain for not working normally, for not being the way it used to be. I would have breakdowns every night before a deadline.\n\nWith every semester, it had gotten worse - I almost didn't graduate high school because I had waited till the day before the very last day of an online class to do an entire course's work.\n\nThen when I got to university, I barely scraped by. My first year had earned me a warning about my gpa. And I'd been so determined to do better. So determined to change - I've always been. The pandemic had torn my mental health apart - but it was okay, because now my classes were going to be in person, there was no excuse to not do well.\n\nFor the first time, this year, during the first semester of my second year of university, I failed every single class I attended.\n\n37 minutes ago was my final extended deadline to hand in a term paper. I am majoring in something I love, in something I'm privileged to be able to study.\n\nBut I stood there in front of a blank screen and did everything I could to distract myself from working. Going on my phone, scrolling through Twitter, playing games, apartment hunting, daydreaming while I listen to music, getting up to make food. Anything to keep myself from feeling any dread, and that would enable me to stay comfortable in my little bubble of self-hate and procrastination.\n\nIt's as if my brain cannot fathom putting in effort into *anything* anymore. I'd like to take a moment that this burnout has impacted all areas of my life. I don't draw. I don't write. I can hardly muster up the strength to write emails. I want so much for myself but it's as if this parasite in my brain manages to manipulate me into doing absolutely nothing. And now I've thrown away four months of dragging my feet through courses for nothing.\n\nI don't know how to change. I love studying literature, and I love the idea of school, but what's the point if I barely put effort into it? If I'm wracking up student debt just to fail? Just to throw it all away.\n\nI don't even know what to do. I'm afraid to tell my mother. She'll be so devastated, and she'll just blame herself. \n\nI don't even know the point of living if I'm just going to be on autopilot my whole life. If I'm just going to dream about reaching my goals, and never actually put the work to it.\n\nI wasn't even spoiled growing up. I was raised by a strong single mother that did everything to make sure I could have a life that I flourish in - but all I do is disappoint her. And my father. \n\nI'm sorry this was really long, but I can't talk to anyone about it and needed to just get it out there.",

        "post": "Background to skim\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOK, so I'm a 26 year old undergrad, no n traditional path. Grew up with a lower middle class, very broken family, lots of issues.  I couldn't go to uni like a normal student at the normal time due to my mom loosing her job right before. I had to struggle through community college, dropping out, trade school, that not working out (graduated but no jobs due to no degree / experience), community college again with a plan to transfer to a uni.\n\nDuring this, my family was dysfunctional and all I had to rely on were online friends.  I was constantly dealing with, what I thought was just, regular depression fueled burn out due to how much had fallen through, how much I had to deal with, but it turned out it was actually ADHD burn out.\n\nWell, two of my online firends went to a uni they pushed me to apply to. I get in, and since it gave me the best finaid deal, I decided to go. To make a long story short after I got accepted, before I started going to the school, one of the friends kept treating opinions I held like they were objectively wrong and I would stand up for myself after this kept happening and she would back up like \"yikes\" like my agresssion came from no where. When I got to the school, this person just acted really cold like we hadn't been good friends for over a year.  The other friend seemed not really interested to hang out with me either, kept saying she was busy but talked about procrastinating and doing other things on Twitter.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo I couldn't count on them, and I also found I struggled with CS and it's math. seeked out supports from fellow students, and the ones I talked to seemed to just tell me to \"Get gud or you'll keep failing\". \n\nI struggled to make friends at mass meetings due to everyone seeming to already have people to talk to, I talked to some and with few exceptions. I feel like an other and like I really do need to dissociate as no one here is all that relatable due to age / class gap (mostly rich kids). I live in a house for graduate students, who are easier to talk to. Point is, all of these things led to trauma. the friendship situation felt like a final straw as I was already used to being treated in ways where I was infantilized, talked over, deceived, gaslit, ostracized etc and I tried to believe things would get better . . .yet they didn't really, if it seemed like it did it all fell apart or didn't last long. \n\nI kept trying to tell people about my perspective on things, and they'd respond like \"how can you think that way, why are you like this?\" I finally one day explained that I went through more than most people, and I was just told it was weird to compare peoples' pasts. I kept getting talked over when I tried sharing how I felt. I was told I was wrong, or I'd get told \"I'm sorry that happened, but this is a weak argument compared to data\" When I tried to tell people how they made me feel, multiple times I got told \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" like they couldn't take any responsibility.\n\nI honestly wish I. could transfer no matter who was wrong. It'd let me heal and sort where I was wrong vs where I wasn't and just understand the situation with given space, but that can't happen due to how fr I am in my degree. My school is big and I really am trying to, when I have time, meet people, but I rarely have the time / energy and I just feel subconciously discouraged to even try to meet people. There have been decent people but there are also people who have sat there and found excuses to invalidate my feelings rather than just say nothing, \"educate me on why what I said was wrong\" and when I broke down and had an over the top tantrum (Autistic meltdown, was still not OK by any means) on the uni's sub, I got people downplaying, being sarcastic, got told to stop projecting, got called mentally ill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are right, at least to a degree, I acknowledge that. I just feel like I really didn't belong here, and when I tried, very, very imperfectly , to make my own space , no one tried to really understand me to any degree and I just kinda feel like giving up to save myself. I just let myself go more than I usually did cause I think I'm just done. I feel like I might be gaslighted into thinking I'm a truly horrible person but I could just really be a horrible person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway sorry for the long post, any words wwould be appreciated.",

I'm in my 4th semester right now and I haven't ever been able to complete my work on time. I always leave things till the last moment. I start off great and end up with jitters, anxiety and half-hearted work that would've been so much better had I started it on time.\n\nI had promised myself that college would be different. Every semester I tell myself the next one will be better. But I genuinely don't know why I can't just stop putting things off. I think I did fairly well in high-school, I graduated with 95%. But I know it could've been better if I didn't study just a week before my finals. Even in college, I have a 3.85 cgpa, but I know I would've made it to the dean's honor list if I had worked on time. It might come off as ungrateful, but it's genuinely a problem. I delay working and then hate myself for it.\n\nThis semester has been worse because I became an undergrad TA. So I have to check assignments and quizzes and report back to my instructor. I still haven't checked the quizzes from 2 weeks ago. \n\nI don't submit my assignments on time, flunk quizzes and don't take that many classes because I tell myself that I will make up for it in the finals. Most of the time I do, it stings when I don't.\n\nI'm aware of the problem, I know I need to fix it, but I can't. What do I do?\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post": "I am currently a second year pre-med student, yet I am only productive when the stress hits, and I always procrastinate because I use the excuse of me worrying not producing good enough quality work as others, and use procrastination as a way to drown away my worrying thoughts. Even if I do work, as I am a slower learner than others, it always takes me longer to learn.\n\nI have not been a hard-working student since college and I want to improve that. Yet semester after semester, nothing has changed. \n\nFor anyone who has improved their study habits, are there any suggestions that help made you more proficient at studying? It's 5 am on the Monday after Thanksgiving and I just started studying, and I hate myself for making bad choices. So any suggestion to help me stop making these bad decisions are appreciated.\n\nPlease notify me if my format is incorrect, I rarely post in reddit and English is my second language, so please tell me if there is anything to be changed.\n",

        "post": "I currently am committed a T30 school, and I am extremely fortunate to have gotten into this school, however I feel that I'm not accomplishing anything as I would like to transfer to an ivy league. For a bit of backstory: In high school, I procrastinated ALOT. In the sense that I would take many AP's and honors classes per year, and I would always do the hw and studying last minute. For example, my junior year I took 4 AP's and 2 honors and my extracurriculars. I would always prioritize extra curriculars and socializing with my friends first. For example, after school I would go home and work on my community service and non-profit, facetime with friends, and play basketball outside till like 10 PM, and then I would come back in and do homework/study for 3 hours straight. I was sleep deprived each day, getting about 6 hours of sleep a night. I wouldn't study a week before tests like my other friends did. I would play video games, and waste time until the night before the test, in which I would sit for like 6 hours straight and study and get 4 hours of sleep + coffee before the test. I STILL managed to get only B's on tests bc of listening in class and participating. Even tho I got all B's on all my tests, my 100 homework and participation grade as well as Extra Credit always pushed me up to an A as a final grade. I was very lazy in my studies all 4 years of high school, especially senior year second semester where I got B's and C's (thank god my uni didn't rescind me), but since my teachers liked me, I got extra credit, and my 100 hw/participation grade, I always ended up with an A. I'm still very lazy, and I am scared that the competitive environment next year will kill me bc I always do everything last minute. What can I do to make sure I use my time effectively starting from now?",

        "post": "Hey guys, I don\u2019t use Reddit much but I am in a very desperate situation rn plz help. My procrastination has finally gotten the best of me. I feel rlly defeated rn and rlly scared. during high school, it was very easy to procrastinate and do well on my classes. I excelled in sciences so I chose to study engineering.  I got high grades by studying a couple days before the finals but Almost missed uni admissions. luckily, I was able to get accepted a couple weeks before my classes start. I always wanted to organize my life. I always wanted to be ahead of schedule and become a proper good student. But since grade 10, I would try and try again just to go back to heavily procrastinating. and no matter how upset I am with my self, I still can\u2019t seem to change. For example, I took ap calculus ab and bombed it (got a 1). I didn\u2019t study at all. I was so unbelievably upset with myself that I swore to do better next time. Next year I did ap calculus bc along with ap physics. And guess what I bombed it again (bc was 2 physics was 1). I have tried out so many methods to fix this issue and get my life in order. Methods such as such finding my issues and solving them, meditation, daily reminders, lists, schedules, time tables, journals, and countless other things. It just isn\u2019t working out for me. I think my procrastination has gotten worse after starting uni. when i was in high school, I would plan to start studying 2 weeks before the final,  but idk just the pressure of the final and the expectations for a good grade caused me to avoid it. It would continue as a cycle of fear, avoidance, and regret until 2 days before the final.( and the time would always fly by so fast). and finally for those last 2 days I would continuously grind. But now instead of that, I just procrastinate more. Heck, I\u2019m procrastinating on sleeping rn by typing this stuff out. Rn my situation is bad. I haven\u2019t gone to any of my classes, and my math final is literally the day after tomorrow. And my Chem final is two days after. Not only that it is weighted at 65 percent bc I didnt study for midterms. My 4 midterms is between 25 to 60 percent. And my assignments and labs are arvg of 80 to 90 percent. I did start studying 14 days before but for some reason made no progress, again bc I procrastinated. I just can\u2019t change. Idk how to change, and idk what to do now. Am I going to be kicked out? I\u2019m thinking of taking a semester off and going to therapy Bc no matter how hard I try, no matter what techniques I use, it isnt helping at all. my plan rn is just To grind all day tmrw and hope for the best. I really do want to graduate. I always wanted to get a masters for biomedical engineering, it\u2019s been a dream since childhood. I\u2019m just so upset how fast time flew by. I know I\u2019m smart enough to do this. rn I just feel like a loser and a failure. I also don\u2019t know what my family would say. I am Chinese Asian so it\u2019s not going to be good for me. Sorry for this mess of a text Im thping as fast as possible to I can sleep. i just don\u2019t know what to do. its just such a pain to live every day like this. I can\u2019t stress how much I want to change and improve my life. Plz help and gn.",

But all in all, I called it a day, ate some food, and hit the sack.\n\nTuesday: Same thing, different day. I ended up listening to music and watching YouTube for... I don't know how long. I looked on and on at my assignments.\n\nWednesday: A little different, my dumbass decided to go \"run some errands,\" preferably because a bird pooped all over my car. I didn't have a hose head, so I made an excuse to go out. I did this rather than complete my work which is due by the end of the week.\n\nThursday: Now I realize that I need to get this shit done, but there I was, procrastinating away, going on YouTube, watching the television. What have I become?\n\nFriday-Sunday: Sunday is when the majority of assignments are due; from this span of three days, I still have done nothing except for Saturday afternoon all the way up to now. Here I was scrambling to get these literature discussions, quizzes, and assignments done as well as completing the majority of my stats problems and other homework before 23:59. My brain felt as if I was on 5 cans of Redbull, but I was coked up on adrenaline beating myself up and saying, \"I have no excuse for my stupidity and laziness; I had all week to do this.\"\n\n# But on the good side...\n\nI recently finished the last of my tests and homework that I honestly could have completed during the week; I turned in the first bit at around 1700. and the rest at about 22:30 and so forth. Maybe it was my brain trying to get back in the groove of things. Hell, even the Summer semester was 3x as worse in terms of rapidness. Assignments were due far earlier.\n\nOh well, at least I didn't just throw these assignments off and grew into a lazy bastard; I sucked it up and told myself that I basically have no excuse to beat myself up. Just finish what is in front of you, learn from your mistakes made, and get on with the next week.\n\n**TLDR:** I procrastinated heavily on my classes this week, ended up scrambling to finish all the assignments for the week that were due today (Sunday).",

        "post": "To my dear friends, who also striving for self improvement as I do:\n\nGuys, I've just read in the book from the Stanford Psychologist - Robert Cialdini. (Book: Pre-Suasion)\n\nThe professor offers his number number one, the best trick of overcoming procrastination and becoming more productive.This method uses \"Zeigarnik effect\" to reinforce itself and keep you much more effective and productive overall.\n\n* According to this professor - 2 important conclusions emerge out more than 600 studies the topic  \n\n\n1. We will remember all sorts of a task better if we not yet have the chance to finish this task\n\n* Because our attention remain drawn to it\n* 2. If we are engaged in such a task and are interrupted or pulled away we will feel the discomforting knowing desire to get back to it\n* So, it\u2019s very same desire which also pushes us to return to:  \n\n* incomplete narratives\n* Unresolved problems\n* Unanswered questions\n* And underachieved goals\n* Reflects a craving for cognitive closure\n* It was just a part of the trick of the scientific trick of overcoming procrastination\n* Flowing is the essence\n* Now, believe it or not this professor and the author Robert Cialdini was fighting with procrastination himself while writing his books, as he confesses later  \n\n* It was really easy to get distributed and fall down procrastinating\n* That's the dilemma he says\n* In his new best selling book \u201cPre-Suasion,2017\u201d the Stanford professor recalls being impressed by the method of overcoming procrastination that his colleague also a scientist and the author had been using  \n\n* As he mentioned it the book \u201cPre-Suasion\u201d\n* She never lets herself to finish a writing session at the end of a paragraph or even a thought\n* She assured, that she knows precisely what she wanted to say at the end of that last paragraph or thought\n* She just does not allow herself to say it until the next time\n* By keeping the final feature of every writing session near finished use uses the motivating force of the drive for closer to get her back to her chair quickly\n* Impatient to write again\n* This strategy works perfectly, by reinforcing itself by the \"zeigarnik effect\" that we discussed earlier in this video\n\nIt was the essence. But, I went a bit further.\n\nSo to explain all the idea to you, I've created a short very informative (5 min YouTube video) with all the references to sources\n\n[https://youtu.be/qNYB7msxkK0](https://youtu.be/qNYB7msxkK0).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rs6gfebfzba11.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f50faa6e786ed975b823a08e3315dd1ad6391913\n\n[https://youtu.be/qNYB7msxkK0](https://youtu.be/qNYB7msxkK0)\n\nI am really grateful to you, if I was helpful.",

After that, I felt bad about it since  I spent less time working on my assignments from both course every week and more time watching YouTube on my phone and sleeping. I would only work on them if the deadline is on every Sunday. Some day later, my uncle wanted to call me and asked me how I'm doing with school and I told him exactly what happened. He was pretty understanding about it and he told me that I should learn to use time management, which I never actually used despite that I learned about it in GUST (Psychology), if I want to do well in college. I have my next courses this semester and I can't screw that up again; I don't want my father to pay for my courses a lot.\n\nMy uncle said that I should learn from my mistakes as I would need to have faith in myself and not procrastinate too much. Sure I can procrastinate, but that would lead to carelessly overdoing it and that would come off as taking all the time I need to pass my classes for granted. That's what I did. That's why I'm starting to do my homework from College History this week and later I'll do my Macroeconomics homework before Sunday despite that I slept again and was on my phone again lol. But I'll work hard on my assignments from both classes and I'll continue working hard on them so I can pass my new courses this time. Wish me luck.",

        "post": "Hi all, I've read a couple posts of what you've all said and I'm hoping to be able to find some advice from you guys. \n\nSo it is finals season and I've found myself in extreme curve of the burnout phase. It's been with me the entirety of the semester, but it's getting really bad now. I've tried to force myself to study by putting my phone to the side and sitting down to study, but I end up drifting off thinking about some random topic or just standing up and daydreaming. During lectures I have to put a lot of brain power simply into focusing on the lecture, and for the life of me, I cannot sit watch videos/read the textbook because of the same issue I have with studying.\n\nI really hate that this is happening. I feel so undisciplined and immature. Even now, I have a test on Tuesday and instead of studying I had the thought to make this post instead. I just feel like playing games or scrolling on TikTok all the time. Even when I get bored of that, I put off my studying and homework.\n\n It really makes me angry that I can't seem to be a normal student and I just burnout/get distracted so easily. I know I have the capability to learn the material, but it's like I'm self-sabotaging all the time. I lay in bed for too long, I procrastinate, etc. All of these things combined just make me feel so inferior and it just hurts.\n\nI just really need some advice to help solve this issue. I don't know why I'm sabotaging myself and it's so infuriating.",

I tend to work well under pressure, so I would wait until the night before assignments to start them or I would study for tests the morning before the test etc. Example: Last year during finals, I spent 3 days watching Netflix instead of studying and then first began studying at 2:00am the night/morning before I had two finals.

I want this year to go well SO badly. I already know things like \u201cbreak a big project/paper into small manageable tasks\u201d. But like.

        "title": "Tips for College Freshmen",
        "post": "I wrote this as a comment in someone's post but decided to make it my own. Basic but great tips for College Freshmen, or College students in general.\n\n1. Don't take classes lightly just because you're a freshman, study and go to class. Don't listen to those who are always acting cool and bragging because they skipped class.\n\n2. If your professor assigns homework, and it isn't graded, do all that homework and make sure you do it all right. Those questions will 9/10 times appear on your exams and/or quizzes.\n\n3. Take breaks when studying, not 80 hour breaks, but reasonable breaks for long study hours.\n\n4. Don't, Don't DONT DONT DONT DONT DONT Procrastinate, they say money is the root of all evil, in college, procrastination is the root of all evil. If you have an exam in 2 weeks, plan for it, study slow, take your time, 3 days before review, day before review, and then take the exam. Don't wait till its 8pm on Sunday while you're watching Friends on Netflix and still considering studying for your 8:30am class. Don't do this, trust me, trust me, trust me, it hurts and it hurts alot when you knew you had the chance but wasted it.\n\n5. If your stuck, ask for help.\n\n6. Make study groups, join study groups, start a study group.\n\n7. Don't sleep on trying to get internships early and getting your game on, you will look way way way better than all the current freshmen with you. Just try, you won't lose anything. Go to career fairs, network with people there, even if you don't want an internship right now try to get some companies interested in you, show that you're serious and of value.\n\n8. Don't be the that person who goes all 4 years not socializing or talking to anyone, it hurts. Join clubs ( I didnt join clubs even though I wanted to so badly, I'm an idiot for not doing so, I completely regret it, well I still can tbh lol ) You'll make friends, gain experience while having fun, be involved, and enjoying your time. Note that clubs are not your only option, talk to random people on campus, people in class, go to school events, have lunch with a stranger (who knows he might be into all the weird any crazy stuff you're into), if you can, try to join a sport, go to school games, etc. \nMy freshman year I was sick of keeping myself in my comfort zone and literally walked around campus talking to completely random people I have never met or talked to before in my life. I would ask someone where the library was just to start up a conversation, when it was in clear sight in front of both of us, lol.\n\n9. Get some part-time job, it'll teach you responsibility, I'm still in college and I started working more this year and it is indirectly helping me plan and implement things, and manage my time. Preferably a job or volunteering related to your major, paid or unpaid the experience and responsibility is way more valuable than the money.\n\n10. Stay physically healthy, go to the gym, workout, run, exercise,sweat, swim, this will keep your body and mind healthy. 2 birds with 1 stone, don't miss.\n\n10. Have fun, its college, if you don't feel like going to parties you don't have to. I never went to a college party, currently a Junior, and don't really intend on doing so. Theres so much more you can do, plan a guys or girls night, movie night, go skiing, game night, go out to NYC, see if any cool events are going on on campus, play ball at the gym, swim, go bike riding, explore campus (this is actually fun to do alone, you'd be surprised with what you can find) \n\nOverall Story: Don't waste College, have fun, enjoy your time, use it wisely (USE YOUR TIME WISELY, WISE-LY, W I S E L Y)\n\n**People are talking in the comments and saying how I shouldn't give advice because I don't go to college parties and that I'm not implementing these because i don't go to college parties. It was my decision whether or not to go to parties, I have friends who go to parties and have no problem with them. I was friends with the DJ at the parties and still didn't go. I was childhood friends and still currently am friends with one of the frat leads, but I still didn't go to party. I simply don't want to go to one and prefer having fun in different ways. Having \"fun\" doesn't only mean going to a party, there's much more you can do. If you feel like going to a party, go ahead, if that's what you like and enjoy, then do it. If you don't, there's nothing wrong with that too.**\n\n",

        "post": "This is mostly for people who did well in high school without effort and now have to time and project management skills. \n\nTLDR; I thrive on schedule but have to legitimately force myself to stick to them. I used these tips to stay on the Dean's List, procrastinate mindfully, stop wasting time on studying ineffectively, and ease the stress of 18 college hours with my 3 homeschooled kids and a job.\n\n-MAKE A WORKSPACE: Make a little area that you keep your school stuff at. Sit there an hour a day to work, make important phone calls, ect. Your \"adulting\" spot. Dont doodle there. Dont eat dinner there. Dont play video games there. Even if it's a backpack, chair, and a tv tray. Mine is a desk in a closet. Decorate meaningfully. A school vision board and an erasable calendar maybe. \n\n-If you can, take notes on one word document so that you can search your notes instantly for a keyword. \n\n-MAKE TIME (just a little) to actually work. Everyday. Like a job. Even when you have no work to do, sit down at your desk for a bit every day and find something important to do that is unpleasant/has been put off and do it in that \"work time\". Make that appointment you havent made, call the matenience to fix the dishwasher you have been not using for a week bc you havent called, do whatever and limit the adulting to that hour and do it everyday. You'd be surprised how much an hours of actual work can get done if its consistent. But consistency is hard for me so I have to enforce it. My kids have an hour or so of nap/quiet time in their rooms while I work, and I rarely if ever need more time than that. Most of the time I spend outside of that is on important tests that cant be interrupted. \n\n-RITUALS: No not those. But you cant just sit down and expect to switch gears. Do something everytime you sit down to work that gets you \"in the zone.\" Maybe it's a cup of water and a journal, or checking your calendar or whatever, or even a cigarette and 20 minutes of a game that you only play right before you buckle down, set a timer. Setting out 15 minutes  or so to sit at my desk and bullshit actually makes me work better. \n\n-ONLY HIGHLIGHT key words in notes and textbooks. If the course has many dates and names, consider highlighting those in a seperate color.\n\n- COMBINE POWERPOINTS all the teachers powerpoints she sends out into one giant  PowerPoint that you can search for keywords efficiently.\n\n-COPY AND PASTE all test questions that allow it into ONE master document of test questions for each class: if you can correct the wrong answers after, even better. This takes no time if you do it during the tests, or print screen after you've taken it. Not all classes allow this, though.\n\n-INDEX everything that you cant search easily. If you do it as you go, it's easy but it's hard to get started. \n\n-  *Leave it for the due date* , if you have to, but not the night it's due. Work in the morning. Trust me. Wake up at the same time everyday. Do something pleasant for a limited time and then work until you're done for the day. Then you can enjoy you're whole day without the clock ticking down to 11:55PM when that quiz is due that you've known about for 2 weeks and havent done. It's going to happen, it always will, but it you do it that morning, you will always feel better. \n\n- Bring your snack or drink with you and dont get up, if you can manage that.\n\n- totally optional: Bullet journals. Especially for those that love to be creative, hate taking notes, and cant seem to get organized. Everyone loves to be organized and consistent, deep down.",

        "post": "Okay, so basically, you know how when you're starting university, seniors or people around you would say, \"Oh. Just do a lot practice questions.\" or \"You should do past-year papers.\" whenever you ask for study advice. Well, they aren't wrong, of course. Valid tips but I never really understood why. What do we learn from doing a lot of practice questions or past-year papers? I never knew the reason for it. Is it just me? Am I that dumb or not? Lol. Anyways.\n\nSo what I am about to share is sth similar. You're still going to need to do problem questions or past-year papers BUT make it an open-book test. I'm going to make it easier for y'all to read by numbering the steps haha. I think it is pretty effective in all courses?\n\nNote: This CAN be done at any given time but I recommend doing it right in the BEGINNING of the year or the first semester.\n\n1) Gather all your note sources like text-books or lecture notes. Anything that you have on hand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Pick a few questions (ranging from simple to complex) or a past-year paper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Set a REASONABLE amount of time for how long you'll tackle the questions. Let's say you set 4 hours for a paper that contains 4 LONG questions. The time limit, hopefully, gives you a sense of urgency and motivation to look through your notes while answering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) While you're attempting the questions, rely on your notes. Pretend it's an open book exam. Let's say you're currently in your first few weeks of class, you either have no clue on what you are learning or still learning the basics.\n\nWhen you're flipping through the notes on that specific chapter, you will have to skim/screen and sort of read through the content and each pages really quickly to find a right answer. When you skim through the content, you'll be able to somewhat understand the basics of the topic or at the very least know what is in that topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) Once the time is up and regardless whether you've answered all the questions completely, stop writing. Read your essays and compare it to the notes. See what points you did not write down. Highlight them. Then, reread the notes on those chapters. By this time, you will hopefully be able to easily understand the topic and wouldn't waste too much time trying to understand.\n\nYou would not risk procrastinating if you can understand the topic easily. I know what procrastinating is like. The more blocks you meet, the easier it is for you to give up and it NEVER ends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6) DO NOT use google during the test. You're trying to test yourself. You're supposed to NOT know the chapter in detail.\n\nHopefully this will be useful. Of course, it may or may not work for you because everyone has a different and more effective study method for themselves.\n\nGood luck, guys!",

Im just simply not interested. And it doesn't help that the professor's voice makes me want to fall asleep. I literally procrastinate doing microbiology by studying for my other classes. I would try and watch the recorded lectures but I can't focus and I would be constantly looking at the time bar to see how far I have gotten or how much I have gotten left. I tried split screening and playing tetris to see if that will stimulate me enough to not ignore it all together but it still doesn't work. I think I may have to play it at 2x the speed to see if that will force me to pay attention\n\nThis is a pharmacy school prerequisite so I know that I will need to know this information. At least if it was an elective like religion then I wouldn't be too concerned",

        "title": "Studying Tips and Apps that have helped me during Remote Learning",
        "post": "Hello!\n\nJust know that this post does NOT mean I have my life together and I am acing all my classes. Actually quite the opposite, I am having a very bad quarter (worst in the 4 years I've been at college). Remote learning is just not for me, and I feel that some of you can say the same.\n\nIt is hard to stay concentrated, motivated, and just not lay in bed all day with stacks of HW to do. And I can truly understand the struggle, it has taken me until this moment right now to find what works for me and it is still not enough. Although, I hope this helps at least one of you to try some of these \"tips\".\n\n**1. Use the Pomodoro method**\n\nI like using the app \"**Focus Tomato**\". You will study for 25 minutes straight with NO distractions and do as much as you can. You can stare at a screen for 25 minutes if you want, but just do something that is not procrastinating. Then, you have a 5-minute break. Use this strictly, do not slack or else you won't see the method will work. Also, the Focus Tomato app collects all the times you completed the 25 minutes and you can see how long you have studied for.\n\n**2. Separate your \"study\" area from your \"relaxed\" area**\n\nIf you study at a desk, ONLY study at the desk. If you are going to take a break or procrastinate then do it somewhere else. You want your mind to know that this designated spot is for learning, just like if you were in the classroom. You want to strictly do this, especially if you can't concentrate at home (as your whole house seems like a relaxed space). Find a spot that will be your \"study\" spot and stick to it! (Note: some people like to wear actual clothes to make it feel like they are going to school)\n\n**3. Make To-Do lists/Block time**\n\nI personally have two planners: one will be a checklist of what I need to do and then I will use the app \"**TimeBloc**\" to block the time that I will roughly complete it. This helps visualize and tackle if you're overwhelmed with how many missing assignments you have (or how much HW you have in general).\n\nExtra: I use the app **Notion** on my laptop that helps me create checklists, notes for class, schedules, etc. There are so many templates on it, that may help you in school (or even work!). I highly recommend you guys check it out! (Very clean interface and design, which is what makes me appealed to it).\n\n**4. Stay Connected**\n\nIf you can, try to make group chats/discord, etc. to stay connected to people in your class. I am sure it can be scary to talk to people you have not met before, but I can assure you at least 1 person would be grateful to have someone in the class they can talk to. Email, canvas message, whatever; just ask!\n\n**5. Give yourself breaks; You're Mental Health is Important**\n\nAnd lastly, if you need a break, PLEASE give yourself a break without any guilt. If you know you are trying your absolute hardest then there is nothing more to feel guilt over, you NEED a break. If you burnout before you finished a task, I assure you it will take longer to recover than just taking a break (5-min to even 2 hours!). A burnout will take DAYS, WEEKS, maybe MONTHS to recover depending on how long you have been going.\n\n**6. Use All your Resources** \n\nPlease, take advantage of your school's resources, that is if you have free tutoring, TA session, counseling, and don\u2019t hesitate to email your professor! The worst is they won\u2019t reply back, but at least you did what you could!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I have more \"tips\", but I will add them in edits as I remember them. Hopefully, this finds you! And just know you can do it and we will all get through this one way or another!",

        "title": "A guide to life in college (long post)",
        "post": "This guide was written out of inspiration from a reddit comment that I wrote in response to someone asking how to get a 4.0 in college. My advice was not to focus on the grades as much as the overall learning experience, and other important aspects of college, which often get overlooked from a usefulness perspective. These aspects include networking, learning outside of the classroom, exposing yourself to new things, and keeping ones life balances, and trying to keep oneself healthy, both in body and spirit.\n\n## First off:\n\nBalance is important to maintaining a healthy life and maximum productivity. The amount of stuff you get done is not based purely on the amount of time in which you attempt to be productive. Procrastination is often a result of emotional stress and anxiety, and not laziness. Telling yourself to \"just do something\" will not make it easier to be productive towards a particular goal.\n\nThis guide aims to give you advice on how to effectively manage your college experience.\n\n## Time Management\n\nTime management is an essential part of being productive. You don't need to account for every second of every minute, but you need to create a schedule that works for you. Attempt to find the worse uses of your time, and eliminate them form your habits.\n\nUse time between classes wisely.\n\nTry to track time and figure out where it goes.\n\n## The Big Five\n\nI like to think of \"the big five\" them as MEDSS \"meds\" with two s's. The big five are meditation, exercise, diet, sleep, and social (activity). Incorporating these into your life on a regular basis will vastly improve it. There may not be any magic pill, but these things will improve your life likely more than any medication will (with some notable exceptions if you are gravely sick). \"The Big Five\" also\n\n### Meditation\n\nMeditation can be easily started with an app such as headspace, or insight timer (I believe there are many others, these are just the ones that I happen to use). Only takes 10-20 minutes a day, and you will see real improvements in your life.\n\n### Exercise\n\nExercise should be done at least 3x a week, and can be in very many forms. You can do strength training, yoga, cardio (running, rowing, stair stepping, HIIT), climbing, team sports, and many other things. I personally do strength training with some cardio thrown in (not as often as I should with the cardio, but I'm working on it). **Remember, an exercise activity you will do is more important than something that is ideal for maximum health, that you never do.**\n\nI believe that strength and cardiovascular training should be included in everyones workout routine. I personally started strength training with Stronglifts 5x5, and I highly recommend it as something that is simple and easy to get started with. Starting strength is another good option. Please note: you _need_ to use proper form, or you will end up injuring yourself over the long run, I suggest watching the Stronglift's videos and reading the articles on form, and getting a knowledgable friend to check your form. (this does not take much time, just an hour or two, and you don't have to do it all at once)\n\nYou can avoid injuries by starting light and working on your form as you add on weight. If you follow Stronglifts you shouldn't have an issue. I did it for 2 years and was previously totally untrained (no previous lifting experience). With 3x a week I made some serious progress. Additionally, strength training will increase the amount of muscle on your body, while decreasing the amount of fat (depending on your diet), so you'll look *hotter*.\n\n### Diet\n\nI am no expert on diet, and there are many debates over what is healthy, mainly make sure to limit your caloric intake (so that you don't gain weight), and to lose weight if you are overweight. I recommend looking into fasting, as it seems to be a useful tool if used properly. HOWEVER PLEASE TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR, AND NOTE THAT FASTING CAN HAVE HUGE EFFECTS ON HOW YOU SHOULD BE DOSING MEDICATIONS.\n\nI also suggest focusing on eating foods with less added sugar, making sure you get your proper daily intake of nutrition. If you want to lose weight, cutting out any beverage that is not water can make a huge difference. Additionally, eating foods that fill you up can help you eat less, since you will be satiated.\n\nNote: if you start lifting, make sure you eat enough, otherwise it will stunt your progress\n\n### Sleep\n\nSleep is something that very many people vastly overlook. Getting 7-8 hours of sleep a night is essential for your physical health, emotional wellbeing, and especially for your productivity. Productivity is not a function of hours in times some constant is equal to productivity. Productivity has many factors including your state of mind, how clear your head is, are you actually able to sit down and work to get started. You may gain 2 hours in the day by sleeping 6 hours a night, or gain 4 hours by sleeping 4 hours a night, but you will murder your productivity and health not only in the long run, but in the short run.\n\nTwo weeks of getting 6 hours a night is like having a 0.08% BAC, the legal limit. Also staying up for 18 hours consecutively produces similar effects. Sleeping less may be okay for one night at a time, but if you do it every night, you will be less productive, despite having more hours to work.\n\nA very small percentage of the population can manage getting by with less than 7-8 hours, but they are a tiny minority. About 1-5% of the population, I forget the exact statistic. YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT IN THAT GROUP.\n\nCollege kids, and people in general like to brag about how little sleep they get. Don't be like them, get a healthy amount of sleep. You'll come out ahead in the long run.\n\nSleep is especially important the nights before exams.\n\nAdditionally, try to go to bed at the same time, and wake up at the same time every morning, including weekends.\n\nNo blue light before bed, preferably no screens at all. Try reading a book. :)\n\n### Social (activity)\n\nBelieve it or not social activity is important to good health. I happened to ignore this for many years, because I tend to isolate myself when I am busy and stressed, and figure I can get more done by staying in my room for days at a time. Social interaction during the day is good, but taking time to get away from your room/routine also does good, especially if you can go to a game night, or concert, or whatever with friends. I don't know exactly what the research says about frequency, but I'd suggest trying to do something at least once a week for a couple of hours. By this, I mean do something outside of normal mingling and gossiping at your workplace, before and after classes, etc.\n\nSocial accountability is another powerful tool that will help you. If you can get your friends to be disappointed in you when you don't study properly, or do something you're supposed to do, like exercise, it will be a massive deterrent against doing things poorly. Additionally, finding an exercise buddy can be useful to help you blow off steam, and to encourage you to exercise when you don't want to.\n\nA large part of college is the developing of social relationships, even though you may not be told this going in. Take time to date, meet new people, join clubs, try new things. You will likely not have many of the same opportunities again\n\nDon't hang out with people who are going to get you to do stupid things, and who don't have any ambitions, they _will_ drag you down with them. It doesn't matter if they are good people at heart.\n\nOn the flip side, if you hang out with hardworking and successful people, they will encourage you to work harder, and you'll see what helps them succeed. After college they'll be helpful to help you network.\n\nI seriously regret not spending more time with people in college, my mental health would've been better, and I would have likely had better grades as a result, hell maybe even a girlfriend, or some fun stories to tell.\n\n### Dating\n\n**_Never again in life will you be surrounded by so many attractive peers, who are generally open to  many with high ambition. Make use of this opportunity._**\n\nHowever, keep in a mind, a good relationship may improve your life a little bit, but a bad one will make it much worse, in other words, get out of bad relationships as fast as you can, and preferably stay away from toxic individuals.\n\n## Grades\n\nMy original response was to someone who asked about getting a 4.0 in college. My response was, don't focus on an arbitrary target, so much as making sure you use your time wisely. If you are trying to get into medical/law/dental or other professional schools, or into graduate school, having a good GPA is important. However, there are things to consider about GPA.\n\nSay getting a 2.5 GPA takes 10 hours a week of studying, 3.0 takes 15 hours a week, 3.5 takes 25 hours a week, and a 3.75 takes 40 a week, and maybe a 4.0 takes 50 hours a week. Diminishing returns start to kick in heavily. What if you spent that time doing research, or interning, or in clubs and activities that help you build your network. Hell, maybe you could start your own company. Outside of getting into graduate school or a professional program, your GPA won't really matter past your first job. That being said, I'd shoot for at least a 3.0-3.5. (these numbers are 100% made up, find the balance that works for you and your goals)\n\nFind the balance between schoolwork and research, internships, and clubs or other activities. The balance point will be different for everyone.\n\nYour connections, will matter for the rest of your life, as your friends start to move from company to company, and as some of them climb corporate ladders and start their own companies. These connections will get you farther than an extra .25 on your GPA ever would.\n\n**Do not beat yourself up over bad grades**, if you do this you will increase your chances of developing depression. Focus on managing your time effectively. If you manage your time effectively and do not receive the grades you want, it sucks, but it's okay. You can only do so much, and if you are making the most of your time you should be proud of yourself. Continual improvement is more important than perfection. Consistency is also very good.\n\nConsider trying to develop good relationships with a handful of professors who you will use as references for jobs, recommendation letters, etc. It is especially useful if you do research or other non-coursework related activities with them, as they will get to see more of who you really are, and your work ethics.\n\n### Studying\n\nThere are effective, and ineffective ways to study and complete coursework. Start off by _going to class_, it'll really make a difference even if you don't think you're learning much. Go and take notes by hand. Taking notes by hand is the most effective way to make sure you're internalizing the information from the lectures.Additionally, ask questions in class, and go to office hours, it doesn't matter if you feel like an idiot, your understanding of the course material is more important than what your classmates think. Most of the time other people in the class have the same question. If you're too afraid to ask during class, go to office hours (this is also a good chance to develop a relationship with professors).\n\nReading the textbook can be useful for some classes, but not so much for others.\n\nDo homework. Homework gives you practice, and practice makes you better at remembering material, and using complex problem solving abilities. The more you develop problem solving abilities, the easier any question will become.\n\n[This video] is a good source for evidence based studying techniques.\n\nMy advice is to trying and make connections between all the concepts in your mind, and how they relate, this will enable you to remember things you forget through related information, or may make you able to reconstruct a piece of information from other pieces of information. This technique has been useful to me many times. People often waste lots of time using rote memorization, but if a question on an exam is slightly different than something they expect, they'll be totally lost, whereas someone who understands the concepts well can adjust quickly, and digest the information.\n\nI did disproportionately well on many exams despite my sometimes lackluster performance on homework. I believe it was due to my focusing on understanding of concepts, and not memorizing problem solutions.**Dumb songs, acronyms and other mnemonic techniques will make things easier to remember, even if they sound stupid.**\n\nOn exams I start at the beginning, and when I get stuck on a question, I stop and move on to the next one, often times a solution to something I was previously stuck on will come to me eventually. It is also good to look at all the questions on an exam before starting so you think about them in the back of your head. I don't know if this is pseudoscience, but it works well for me.\n\nStudy over weeks, don't cram the night before an exam. Also, make sure you get plenty of sleep the night before an exam, it doesn't matter how much you studied if your brain is functioning at 25% capacity because you didn't sleep before the exam. Get 8 hours.If you're interested in learning to master your memory, check out \"Moonwalking with Einstein\". Anyone can train their memory to memorize lots of things quickly, which can be useful for some classes (and less useful for concept based classes). However, this will take time. I have not tried practicing the techniques, but it is an interesting and worthwhile read.\n\nI suggest figuring out every class you want and are required to take, and make a timeline of when you'll be taking them. Maybe you'll see if you can dual degree or double major, it's much easier to do now than in a few years. Classes will get harder (probably).\n\nYou might consider taking a few classes in different disciplines in order to make sure you want to stay in your major, it'll make switching easier if you have a few classes done.\n\nOr, consider doubling down and finishing your classes a year early so you can graduate, or maybe start taking graduate classes and do lots of research.\n\nTake breaks from homework and spread out assignments, sometimes going to bed and then looking at the assignment in the morning will make a difference. Try to do them as soon as they are assigned (assuming you have been taught all you need to do them). This gives you more time to reach out to professors and TA's, and time to put them away when you get stuck.\n\n",

        "post": "I was always a huge procrastinator in middle school, and even high school. You know; putting work off until the last minute, but then all of a sudden, getting a burst of energy and marathoning the entire workload without stopping? Yeah, that was me, haha. Somehow, I'm one of those procrastinators that manage to get everything done on time, and done nearly perfectly. Never studied for anything, yet always aced those exams. Every high school teacher has told me that college was going to be difficult, and that I wouldn't make it with the amount of procrastinating I do. Fast forward to the sixteenth of December, in the final hours before the end of my very first semester; I'm literally racing the clock, trying to get these last discussion boards (worth 25 points each) in before 12AM. I believe I also had one essay to do as well. Somehow, I managed to do all of this and turned it all in before the deadline. End result: the projected final grade going from an F to a B+ (insert sarcastic, relieved laughter here). \n\nGranted, I was running on minimal sleep and a full pot of coffee. Worth it? Absolutely, haha. Now, I don't know anyone else's professors' grading policies, but mine were very laid back: as long as it's turned in before the final deadline, you'd receive the full grade. Are anyone else in here heavy procrastinators like me? Or am I the outlier? \n\nLong story short, first semester down. Now it's time to wait for my next semester while kicking back and relaxing \ud83d\ude0c.",

        "post": "Definitely need to work on this, seeing as it's past 1 a.m. where I am now and I'm asking for advice to randos on Reddit instead of sleeping or doing my homework. Yay, college! :')\n\nIt's my first year in college. We're in the middle of the semester now. Things are piling up. Exams. Papers. All that fun stuff. My big problem right now is still time management and trying to stop procrastination, but I'm also having a hard time balancing work and sleep. I used to go to bed around midnight, 12:30, maybe, but now I'm around 1-1:30. A lot of it is because I'm studying or doing homework, or I've been putting off taking a shower. I know sleep deprivation is practically a given in college, but I think it's starting to get to me, especially considering I'm a night owl and have insomnia most of the time. (It doesn't help that my roommate could probably spend all night reading on her Kindle, so she's never the one that goes to bed first, and I generally lose track of time a little bit because of this.)\n\nBut I'm at the point now where I just feel so drained all the time. I don't even have to get up too early (either 9:45 or 8:45 depending on the day). I've always been kind of a perfectionist when it comes to my work, so I spend too long making sure everything is correct, annotated, you name it, I get distracted while doing it, and before I know it, it's pretty late. And then I try getting ahead in other classes so it won't all pile up on the day it's due, but by the time I know it, I haven't done as much as I thought I did and it's a bit of a scramble regardless. I've been chipping away at studying for an exam on Wednesday and a paper that's due Wednesday, but it feels like I haven't done enough and tomorrow will be a very long day in my little study corner in the library.\n\nIt's kind of a trade-off at this point. Do I go to bed earlier with the risk of not being as prepared for class the next day as I would like? Or do I stay up and feel somewhat better about the next day, even though I'll be exhausted? Just wanted to hear some input on this. What are your strategies for balancing this?\n\nHope that made sense. I think I should go to bed now. Thanks for your time.",

I have a huge issue with putting everything off until the weekend it\u2019s due and then hating myself, rushing, getting 90% done and turned in before calling it good enough for the night and just going to sleep leaving the 10% to get behind. I thought when I was having this issue in 2020 that it was just because I ended up homeless after I started the semester and I was stressed but I\u2019m in a stable situation now and I\u2019m still having the same issue. I just can\u2019t get myself to start until it\u2019s an emergency and then right before I\u2019m done I lose all ability to follow through. I have B\u2019s in both of my classes right now and I have to pass these and the next two with high enough grades to keep my scholarship and financial aid (3.0 gpa). \n\nRewards, self imposed deadlines, etc (basically anything you get when you google \u201chow to stop procrastinating\u201d) don\u2019t work. I don\u2019t care about any reward enough and I can\u2019t set self imposed deadlines. I end up missing them and hating myself more.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations? Is there anything I can do to help this? \n\nI feel like I\u2019m drowning every weekend and it\u2019s frustrating because it doesn\u2019t have to be this way I\u2019m just to weak willed to get my work done and I don\u2019t know why.

Other solutions focus more on showing what to do that helping you get stuff done. Here's what it does:\n\n- Breaks your work down into smaller pieces (30minutes -> 1.5hrs, our attention spans are short)\n\n- Helps you estimate how long work will take (based on your past personal history)\n\n- Adapt to your working habits (\"John really gets a lot of work done at 11pm on Sundays, let's ask him to schedule a short task then to save him time later\")\n\n- Show you how much free time you have and how you can get more\n\n- Help you eliminate distractions\n\n- Syncs with Google Calendar, Evernote and Dropbox (Coming later)\n\n\u2026and more\n\nCollege is just so much better with more free time.\n\nWe're currently here: http://www.peersapp.com\n\nDo these strategies actually work for you too?

My college has an agreement with a large state university that students who get their AA here can be automatically accepted and have their credits transfer seamlessly. My plan was to take this deal and commute to the university for two years while earning my BS in Computer Engineering.\n\nI just got my AA degree at the end of the last spring semester but my housing situation changed unexpectedly when my grandmother passed and we had to sell her house. My dad found a small apartment to live in temporarily until I figured out where I wanted to live for college. \n\nMy first mistake was actually filling out my application for the state college much too late. I think I submitted it in early-mid April. I did not anticipate that the university would take 8 weeks to process my application and accept me. Now that I\u2019ve finally been accepted, I\u2019ve realized this was far far too late. \n\nI finished my AA with a perfect 4.0 GPA, and my assumption was that I would be offered at least a modest academic scholarship package as a condition of my acceptance just like when I was applying to universities out of high school. FAFSA is able to cover the cost of my tuition and I have been reassuring my dad since we lost the house that a scholarship could cover my housing costs. \n\nUnfortunately, I found out yesterday that this university does not automatically generate scholarship offers for transfers, only incoming freshmen, and the two transfer scholarship applications had deadlines far before I was even accepted. I called the financial aid office to basically be told I\u2019m out of luck. So now, after thousands of hours of studying ridiculous hours seven days a week, my hard work is going to be rewarded with absolutely nothing because of my own procrastination and poor planning.\n\nIn addition, because it took so much longer to be accepted than I thought, securing on-campus housing is looking almost impossible. Even if I can get accepted, I now dont have any option to pay for it except for out of my own savings. I can technically afford it without loans, but that\u2019s pretty much all the money I have. My dad is willing to find us both a place to live near campus, but it\u2019s so difficult because the city of my university is extremely expensive and overpopulated. If we do find a place together, the rent is coming right out of my life savings too.\n\nI am at a complete loss. I have no idea what to tell my dad who has worked so hard to help me get through college. I dont know where I\u2019m going to live in 2 months. I dont know how to pay for my education. I don\u2019t even have any passion or excitement for the university I applied for, I just thought it would be a good way to get out of college quickly and with no debt. Now I have to come up with some sort of solution and I truly have no idea what to do.\n\nPlease help me.",

It's got to a point where if I come across any math problem my mind tries everything to make me focus on something else so it doesn't have to deal with the discomfort of not knowing how to do something)\n\n\u2022 If I start making notes and I run out of time, it'll be incomplete, so I'll start when I have more time\n\n\u2022 I've been taught this twice now and I still don't get it, have I become less intelligent?!\n\n**Fear of failure (if exams are close):**\n\n\u2022 I need to go back and read ALL the lecture notes otherwise I won't be able to tackle all types of questions in the exam\n\n\u2022 I don't understand these solutions and so I must not be cut out for this degree. \n\nYou get the idea. This sort of inner thinking has meant that i've developed a serious habit of procrastination as a coping mechanism, and I wish to alter this. My university only examines once a year and so I seldom realise i've put off work until really late. (I've sat 3/5 exams so far and don't think I've passed. However it's never too late to built good habits!)\n\n**Has anybody else dealt with something similar? How should I go about tackling my procrastination?**\n\ntl;dr - I procrastinate because of my perfectionism and fear of failure. How can I change? \n",

        "post": "**Background**: I am a sophomore in college; going online pursuing a business degree while working full time. I also have had a 4.0 GPA all throughout high school and college. In my health class (a required GEM class, not even a business related class), it was stated on the syllabus that late-work for a particular assignment would not be accepted because it is a 3-part process and a part being submitted late would affect the other parts. I turned part one of the assignment in an hour late (due at 12am, turned in at 1am), and emailed the professor the next morning to \"jump in front of\" my mistake and offer to make up for it and in a professional way practically asked for mercy because the one hour between 12 and 1 wouldn't have made any difference. Her response was not helpful and said the **points** for the assignment would count towards the project total and that she doesn't offer extra credit. I took this as I would receive a certain amount of points for the project and left it at that.\n\n**Problem**: Today (1 and a half weeks after the due date), I received a 0% on the assignment with the only comment being \"The assignment is too late for credit. Please see syllabus\". The 0% brought my 98% total grade down to a 78%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Question**: I understand the principle of not being late, and that it is no one faults but my own. But I feel a 0% for one hour is harsh and I also feel as an educator the least she could have done was give me a comment on my work (and not the lateness of it), especially seeing it is part 1 of the rest of the project? I want to email her again saying the 0% is harsh for one hour late and I would like to know how I even did on it, but do I have the right to? Am I being naive in thinking the professor owes me feedback or that a 0% is harsh?\n\n**EDIT:** The professor graded the second part of the project, bringing my project total to a 50% and my class grade to a 91%. I'm not going to email her (at least not about the grade), however it has been interesting seeing everyone's thoughts on this... and lesson learned for the future :)\n\n&#x200B;",

I feel like the attitude in college usually doesn't encourage cooperation or socializing except for classes like philosophy where discussion is literally a foundation for the class.

My work ethic is shit and I procrastinated to the point of no return. Didn't habe any friends due to social shame, isolated myself from the world. My parents are the extremely strict academic type-parents so I didn't dare tell them anything about how I was struggling with uni. Meanwhile I had developed severe depression and went undiagnosed for 2-3 semesters, tried to take my life once but through some miracle I survived.\n\nAfter 4 semesters of hiding, I finally confessed to my parents and they made me feel like I was the dirtiest piece of trash alive. I was extremely scared, ashamed, I just broke down mentally but had no other choice than to switch to anither university. \n\nHere, I had the same problems, still going with my depression and flunked out in my 2nd semester, because I felt so hollow that I couldn't get to studying and just indulged in video games. I kept this fact hidden and now I'm nearing my 4th semester, when I'm actually unable to keep studying my major. I can't switch it anymore either. I have no one to help me and my parents, who take full financial responsibility over my studies, are probably going to have a heart attack (I'm not joking) and feel like I'm out to make their life miserable, which I definitely am. I'm lost and scared.\n\nI tried applying to another university now, but I spent the last 4 years of my life achieving nothing. My lifeline is going, I'm so filled with dread, guilt, shame, anger, frustration, self-hatred day in day out... I don't know where to go. Can anyone help? What should I do? I'm going to talk to a therapist but they take months before I can get an appointment and they're not going to help my situation short-term.",

        "post": "Pre-covid, I was a decent 90s student in high school. I did not have great study habits with procrastination and such but I was always able to learn the material in time for evaluations and achieve reasonably well. However, when covid struck towards the end of my gr.11 year, school and life kind of paused and there was plenty of free time for my YouTube/Netflix/social media habits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the next year, due to covid, school was not so intense so I did not have to do much to achieve well. I was able to get into a pretty good university. At this time in my life, I had a good group of friends, good grades and I was involved in the community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to this year, everything has changed. I understand that moving to university comes with its challenges socially and academically, but everyone around me seems to have their stuff together socially and academically. Socially, I kind of got into the wrong group but I am working on that now. I found a few good people but I find trouble forming deeper connections with them due to the online setting again. I acknowledge that part of this is due to the fact that I was spoiled in the past with amazing friends and that takes time to build. On the other hand, academically, I am really struggling. I am in a pre-med sort of degree so there is a lot of pressure to perform well and be very involved which all of my peers are. However, I can't seem to figure it out. I did not apply for any clubs and extra-curriculars for no good reason? I was literally just too lazy to. When it comes to academics, I just can not get my sh\\*t together and I know for a fact that most people in my program have a 4.0. I have a hard time sitting down to study and do assignments the night before and perform poorly. I clearly lack motivation, discipline, and a good work ethic and I just hate how I used to have it (feels like covid took it away). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExamples of this include the fact that I purposely do not study because I feel to lazy to or when I do study, I do not feel as if I am trying my best. I then blame poor outcomes on my laziness. When I do study though, I still do not perform well which is the most concerning. When writing evaluations, I feel as if I know the basics but not enough to properly answer the question. I used to be able to stay up and live off of a few hours to sleep if it meant putting my academic first but nowadays, I just sleep too much and do not really care to study. Sometimes when I try to sit down and study, my minds wanders and I am not focused at all which basically means that I am not learning anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to get the old me back but the task seems impossible. I do not know how to approach university at all anymore because I have no motivation or study skills which just causes me to cry and sleep all day. Part of me feels like there is a mental block there that prevents me from doing and being what I want for myself. What can I even do about this??",

The first one has all the big things I'd like to get done over the day, and the second one is full of every little step for those projects and other small tasks. I add to that one throughout the day because it makes me feel super productive every time I can cross off even the most mundane tasks like \"eat lunch\"\n\n2. Even if my classes are asynchronous I do work for that class at a set time (like a regular class lecture). This helps me avoid procrastinating work for that class\n\n3.

        "post": "*As most of us know, graduate degrees can be really hard on our mental and physical health. About a year ago, I started a list of quick tips to get out of a funk. I hope that it helps some of you! Let me know your tips as well!*\n\n\nDo you have a **hard time going to bed/waking up** on time?\n\n- Don't work past 10pm (or within 2 hours of going to bed). You need to give yourself some time to settle down before bed. Read some fiction or watch a mindless show/movie. Try to avoid just browsing the internet which can lead to you staying up later than you planned (the story of my life).\n\n- Don't do any work in your bedroom. You need to separate work from rest in your head. When you go to your bedroom, you should feel relaxed. \n\n- Use an alarm clock. Don't keep your phone next to your bed. You don't want to be bothered though out the night with the constant buzzing. This also helps with getting up in the morning by avoiding procrastination (\"the morning scroll\"). Also, don't hit snooze!\n\n- Aim to sleep at least 7.5 hours/night. I've heard multiples of 1.5 hours are ideal, but no idea if this is true.\n\n- If you're sensitive to caffeine, switch to green tea in the afternoon. It's better for your teeth as well!\n\nDo you have a hard time **feeling 'present'**, **mingling with people**, or **thinking about things that aren't your thesis research?** (I find that these are all inter-related.)\n\n- Make sure to get enough *positive* social interaction every week. For example: department coffee meet-ups, pick-up football games, board games, etc. Going to the pub can be positive as well, but keep in mind how much you're spending/drinking.\n\n- Make sure that your entire sense of meaning isn't coming from your thesis work. Make sure to have hobbies outside of your work. Have some interesting things to talk about with your friends. Nurture your natural curiosity!\n\n- Consider trying Mindfulness meditation. I was skeptical, but I think that it helped (even though I don't do it any more).\n\nDo you have a hard time with **procrastination?**\n\n- Make to do lists! Create a hierarchy of tasks by breaking each task into manageable chunks. It then becomes much easier to chip away at projects.\n\n- Try to do something *slightly* more productive with your time (e.g., improve your programming skills on CodeAcademy, DataQuest, etc.). This is good as long as you don't spend too much time on this...\n\n- Uninstall social media from your phone (e.g., reddit, facebook, etc.) and only subscribe to healthy/positive subreddits.\n\nFeel like **your project is going no where?**\n\n- Set up weekly meeting with your supervisor to make sure that you're making steady progress\n\n- Again, make to do lists!\n\nJust **feeling down** in general?\n\n- A lot of this can be physical!\n\n- Check your posture. Are your shoulders rounding forward from being at a desk all day? Imagine there is a string coming out of the top of your head that is pulling you up. Stand tall and proud. Also, check the ergonomics of your desk.\n\n- Smile more! It sounds bad, but you actually can fake it until you feel better.\n\n- Get in early. Aim for getting in everyday by 9-9:30am. You can feel productive without doing anything by just showing up on time.\n\n- Make sure you're listening to *positive* music. \n\n- Try taking vitamin D in the winter.\n\nAre you **putting on weight?**\n\n- Avoid morning snacking by having a whey protein shake with breakfast. They are good for feeling full.\n\n- Alternate meat/vegetarian days. This also helps save money and the environment :)\n\n- Bring lunch whenever possible.\n\n- Stop buying sugary drinks and candy! It's just wasted money anyways.\n\n- Track your progress on MyFitnessPal.\n\nFeeling **unattractive?**\n\n- Make sure you're taking care of yourself!\n\n- Personal hygiene:  Brush twice a day, floss at least every few days, wash your face before bed, moisturize, shave every other day, sleep more, get regular haircuts, etc.\n\n- Appearance: Don't have to spend too much money, but don't let your clothes get too ratty. Focus on classics that don't go out of style.\n\n- Fitness: Aim for exercising +3 days a week. E.g., pick up football/touch rugby, weight lifting, running...\n\nGeneral health related habits:\n\n- Keep in touch with friends. Make lunch dates, movie nights, play sports, etc.\n\n- Read! Aim for 1 book every 2-4 weeks, but don't turn it into work. Make sure that they're entertaining for you (doesn't have to be intense non-fiction or literary classics), but they shouldn't be trash either... I enjoy sci-fi for a good mix of entertainment and content.\n\n- Try to limit multi-tasking. It often feels like we should multitask, but it often isn't very efficient and just stresses you out even more.\n\n",

        "title": "A personal account of a few changes I made to go from serious PhD-related anxiety & depression to a more manageable situation",
        "post": "I thought I'd share my experience going from a state of extremely poor mental health, and terrible relationship with my PhD, to a much better existence, in case it's helpful to any other grad students out there going through what I went through.\n\n**About me:** I'm about half way through a PhD in science at one of those best-of-the-best universities that appear in the top 10 global rankings every year. Part of my programme expects me to relocate to a foreign lab for around 12 months, and I'm in the middle of that period right now.\n\nUntil quite recently, I was suffering from serious, persistent PhD-related anxiety and didn't know a way out. I only saw 3 options: quit my PhD (nope to that), suicide (double nope to that), or work enough to finish. Obviously, work was the best solution, but I found that difficult for the following reasons:\n\n* Some gaps in my technical knowledge: I knew what I was supposed to do, but not how to get my code to do it.\n\n* The assumption that I really *should* already know all the above technical stuff, so felt that asking about it was a stupid question.\n\n* The only people who I felt had a responsibility to answer my stupid questions (supervisors, etc) are non-technical teaching types/people with expertise elsewhere who don't know how my code is supposed to work anyway.\n\n* The only people who would really know how to solve my problems were at other institutions worldwide, who I could have contacted in principle, but who in practice I didn't want to bother with my stupid questions.\n\n* I happened to be the only researcher from my institution deployed to the foreign lab at the time, giving me a whole office to myself. This seemed great initially, but it soon resulted in crushing isolation. Gone were the days when I could roll over to one of my more senior peers and ask a quick question.\n\n* Additionally, no one in my office = no need to maintain good attendance. I went in late, often not at all, and when faced with a brick wall of code I couldn't progress through, I procrastinated (the usual: Reddit, Facebook, Reddit, Imgur, Reddit, YouTube, Reddit and Reddit).\n\n* I suffered in silence for so long and got so far behind that asking about a basic problem would mean admitting I had done next to nothing for the past few weeks/months, making it even harder for me to consider asking for help.\n\n* My supervisor is pretty hands-off (and back in my home country), so I only have to give an update every couple months to my home department via videoconference. Each time I'd have 1-2 weeks warning to prepare a talk, so I'd panic, contemplate self-injury to get out of it, and scrape together maybe 25% of what I should have done in order to have **something** to show and survive the talk.\n\n* This is quite specific to me, but I have a love-hate relationship with food. I used to be obese, but I lost around 35 lbs in my late teens through diligent diet and exercise and achieved a healthy weight (in fact IMHO I looked pretty good), which I maintained throughout undergrad despite frequently failing to prevent myself binge eating. However, during this period of several months of increased PhD-anxiety, almost every day I would go home defeated, stop by the supermarket and buy an absurd quantity of junk food. I ate my feelings because I just didn't have the willpower not to. A typical day's haul might be: sharing-size bag of Doritos, 3x100g chocolate bars and a sack of gummy candy, which I'd consume entirely between the hours of 7pm and midnight while browsing the internet. This obviously affected my weight, sleep cycle, and self-esteem terribly.\n\nHere's a list of things, big and small, that I did (knowingly and unknowingly) to improve my situation.\n\n**I bought an alarm clock**\n\nThis stopped me using my phone as an alarm, and stopped me getting trapped in the \"morning scroll\" in bed.\n\nBefore: my alarm would go off at 8, I would snooze it repeatedly for an hour, then the guilt would set in, but not wanting to face the grim prospect of another day at the office doing nothing, I would put it off by browsing the internet in bed for a couple of hours. Eventually I'd go into the office around lunchtime, on a good day. On a bad day I'd just \"work from home\" i.e. procrastinate at home instead of in the office.\n\nAfter: my alarm goes off at 8, my phone is charging near my other everyday carry items, ready for me to get dressed. I never go back to sleep (sometimes I have a couple of 5 minute snoozes to shake the sleep out of my eyes and stretch before getting up). I get ready and leave my apartment within an hour. I have cultivated a habit of not unlocking my phone until I'm at the bus stop on the way to the office, and I check messages/news during the 20-30 minute ride.\n\n**I uninstalled all social media apps from my phone**\n\nOkay so I kept the various messaging apps to keep in touch with friends and family, but everything else had to go. Facebook, Reddit, YouTube and Imgur were the worst offenders, particularly when they referred me to some news on current events. Inevitably I would end up reading about the latest governmental idiocy or some massive socio-economic problem that would seem so intractible and it would depress me too much. I would burn up my mental energy trying to process how I felt about the issue and trying to solve it, when economics and politics are so much more insoluble than the scientific problems I'm trained to solve. Besides depressing news, I unsubscribed from several depressing/nihilistic meme pages whose content made me feel validated, but which were ultimately reinforcing my depression and anxiety.\n\nFurthermore, the kind of content I consumed though these platforms was in very small, easily digestible chunks. I would say to myself \"just one more swipe\", \"just one more article\" and waste hours because I couldn't pull myself away. Instead, I started reading eBooks on my phone. This means I can still have entertainment for 10 mins here and there, but it's not too hard to tear myself away because the book is a longer term project and it'll still be there when I come back. I'm also getting through many more books (about 1 every 2 weeks) this way.\n\nI still surf the web pretty freely in the evenings, but on a desktop with better things to do (TV/movies/gaming), so my addiction has been curbed.\n\n**I sorted out my diet**\n\nFor years, I've found it helpful to treat my food problems like alcoholism. A small piece of chocolate, candy or other sugar can make me fall off the wagon completely and get into a spiral of regular binge eating, so I avoid it as much as possible. The first few days are the hardest, but eventually my low-carb/complex-carb diet becomes perfectly comfortable, until my next slip-up. Three things that made this easier were:\n\n1) Chugging a whey protein shake after breakfast each morning, which kills any genuine hunger I have for most of the day.\n\n2) Deciding I would eat lunch every day from the office cafeteria (instead of a packed lunch), knowing the only thing I could afford to eat every day was the salad bar with cold meats. This reduced the amount of grocery shopping I had to do and so reduced my exposure to junk food.\n\n3) Using a calorie-counter app on my phone to gamify eating and let my OCD-but-not-actually-OCD help me to meet the calorie targets each day.\n\nBefore: fat as hell, getting fatter, almost obese again, hating myself, not wanting to exercise because I feel terrible.\n\nAfter: back to a healthy weight, feeling good, exercising, sleeping much better. Incidentally, the tastiest thing I eat every day is my cereal in the morning, which is an additional motivating factor to get out of bed because I look forward to that breakfast treat.\n\n**I realised my friends were imposters too**\n\nWe all know that PhD students suffer from imposter syndrome, particularly when things aren't going well. I defined \"imposter\" to mean \"struggling with work, maybe failing a lot of the time, but pretending to be successful so no one knows\". I realised that by this definition, I was indistinguishable from all my friends, who I thought had their shit together. For all they knew, I had my shit together too, because I never let on how much I was suffering. However when I paid attention I realised (from small throwaway comments and jokes) that everyone has productivity issues:\n\nFriend A half-jokes that he spends too much time on Reddit (I know that feel)\n\nFriend B says that he spends all his time \"dossing around\" (i.e. \"goofing off\" in Freedom Units)\n\nFriend C seems to be the ideal grad student, I envy him his diligence, he's always in the lab from 9am-7pm, but then friend D (who he works with) mentions that it took him months too long to do an important task that others were relying on, and D had to do it for him in the end, just to get the group project finished.\n\nI realised that everyone I knew probably felt inadequate at least sometimes, and they probably all thought I had my shit together, and that helped ease my imposter syndrome a bit.\n\n**I picked a few valuable people to think I'm a moron**\n\nIn everyday life, I have a category of people whose opinions I don't care about. This is usually reserved for people I judge to be assholes or morons whose opinion I can't possibly change. For example, a young-Earth creationist I know thinks I'm either a sheep or part of the scientific conspiracy against God because I supported the Earth being billions of years old. Eventually I just gave up and stopped caring what he thought of me.\n\nI picked a couple of people here and there who could help me with my basic problems, and deliberately committed pride-suicide with them by asking the most basic stupid questions I needed answered. It was painful to do, but once it was done, I could mentally shrug and say \"well, the cat's out of the bag now, he knows I'm a dumbass anyway\" and I felt free to ask for more help.\n\nI was (and continue to be) extremely polite, humble and grateful for all their help. I didn't want to be an arrogant idiot, because I had nothing but respect for these colleagues of mine, and still wanted to minimise my impact on their work. (Un)surprisingly, everyone was very friendly and helpful and I made good progress in my work by leveraging these few helpers. None of them have insulted me for asking a stupid question, and even if I have lowered their private, personal opinions of me, they're too professional to let it show, and I've made peace with it because any higher opinions would be undeserved anyway.\n\n**I saddled myself with regular contact with my supervisor**\n\nI suggested to my supervisor that we talk at least every week at a set time via videoconference, so that I'd *have* to talk to him at least at the agreed time, and wouldn't be able to squirm out of it. This helped leverage the part of my mind that used to cause me to go into panic mode every time I had to give an update. Those panics were hell, but they did make me get stuff done. Forcing myself to give weekly updates helped spread out the load, so I didn't ever feel panicked, but had enough pressure to get work done every week. I also got into the habit of emailing little updates throughout the week whenever I made a small step forward, which gave me a teeny-tiny ego boost each time, since I felt I could say \"look, I've achieved **this one specific thing** since we last spoke\".\n\nThis regular stream of emails made it much easier to slip in a casual question here or there without it seeming like a big deal. My supervisor may not be familiar with the tools/software I'm using, but he's a absolute guru/genius when it comes to the underlying science, so the 2-way flow of explanation (me explaining my progress and him explaining some background theory I don't get) has been useful, since he often knows the right questions to ask about my work that will direct me towards the solution on my own, even if he doesn't know the answer himself.\n\nI hope my experience can help some other poor lost grad student some day.\n\n**TL;DR:** Alarm clock not phone, vegetables not chocolate, everyone (and therefore no one) is an imposter, revealed my inner idiot to get the help I needed, started talking to my supervisor more often.\n\n(Edited for clarity and detail)",

        "post": "I\u2019m having a very difficult time finding myself and my path going forward in my 3rd year. I was wondering if anyone else has get this way at any moment of their PhD journey, and what they did to get out of it. \n\nSome background: I went straight to Econ PhD from undergrad at 22 and, while there were definitely struggles to get through qualifying exams and such, did rather well my first 2.5 years. Completed all required coursework and even did a (half decent) 2nd year paper. \n\nBut now, this semester, I\u2019m just supposed to be doing research and frankly - I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing. I have nebulous ideas about topics that really interest me in the cross section between behavioral finance and macroeconomics, but can\u2019t seem to come up with one solid research question to dig into and try to write a paper about. It\u2019s been 5 weeks and I\u2019ve got nothing this semester except some vague topics of interest, and no matter how much I read I can\u2019t seem to decide on anything. To stay productive, yet procrastinating on what really matters (research), I\u2019ve been applying to internships and part time jobs. I feel like the lack of structure of research and the structure of applying to jobs is making me do it. Lol.\n\nI suppose I\u2019m trying to gauge if I\u2019m cut out for this after all, or if I should cut my losses, take my MA, and really go start a career elsewhere. \n\nPS it also sucks being 25 now. So much uncertainty in the world, let alone with the pandemic and such. Thanks.",

        "title": "If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or need immediate support, you are not alone!",
        "post": "We don\u2019t talk about mental health issues enough. I had a relative who had clinical depression for over 30 years, and his symptoms include extreme emotions (super happy or supper sad or super angry or super fearful), insomnia, anxiety, and sometimes even hallucinations (he grab his passport and think he needs to run away somewhere to stay safe). I used to think that he\u2019s just a selfish, impatient, and ill-tempered person. But over the years I\u2019ve come to accept that a lot of this is due to his depression. Not everyone in the family has accepted it unfortunately, even though we all know he is diagnosed with depression.\n\nAnyway, I wrote a post regarding how to find mental health resources and what are the options out there, because a lot of people don\u2019t know where to find them apparently. I hope this will help many of you. It\u2019s important to figure out mental health issues early on (especially in college when you are away from family support). My relative has been on medication for decades. Can you imagine if he was not properly diagnosed??? :O Please let me know what you think or anything you think should be added to it. You can read it from my site [here](https://stellarlane.com/blog/mental-health-resources-in-college) or below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMental health in college students was at a crisis point even *before* the pandemic started. But COVID-19 has exacerbated the amount of stress, anxiety, depression, and other diagnosable mental illnesses in college students. Many students still don\u2019t know where to find mental health resources in college, though.\n\nKeep reading for:\n\n* a snapshot of mental health trends on college campuses, before and during COVID-19\n* college campus mental health services and how to find them\n* off-campus mental health resources\n* how and why to get disability accommodations for a mental illness\n* how to manage a mental illness in college\n\nUse these resources, and share this information with someone else who is struggling.\n\nBut before we go any further:\n\n## If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or need immediate support:\n\n* Call your school\u2019s counseling services center. The phone number can be found on your school\u2019s student affairs website.\n* Call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room if you are in danger of hurting yourself or others.\n* Call school police, who can escort you to counseling centers or the emergency room. Calling them won\u2019t get you into trouble, or anything negative. They are simply there to get you the help you need.\n* Contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255, or use Lifeline Chat (suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/) if you cannot call.\n* Text BRAVE to 741-741 to reach the National Alliance on Mental Illness crisis chat line.\n\n## Mental Health By the Numbers\n\nEven before the pandemic hit, college students' mental health was on the decline.\n\nIn 2019, studies conducted by the National Alliance on Mental Illness showed:\u00a0\n\n* 25% of students have been diagnosed or treated for a mental health condition in the past year (2018)\n* 35% of college students are struggling with mental health problems\n* 27% of college students in the US are diagnosed with depression\n* 11% of college students have been diagnosed with anxiety\n* 57.7% of college students confessed that they have felt \u201coverwhelming anxiety\u201d in the prior year\n* 50% of students admit to having suicidal thoughts\n* Only 9% of college students decide to seek professional help on campus\n* 73.1% of counseling center directors report a significant increase of severe mental health issues in college students\n\nThese statistics show the upward trend of mental illness in colleges, but don\u2019t reflect how COVID-19 has shifted the mental health outlook.\n\n## How has COVID-19 affected college students' mental health and wellbeing?\n\nAccording to Active Minds, a nonprofit dedicated to spreading mental health awareness and advocacy efforts, conducts biannual surveys measuring the state of mental health in college students.\n\nAfter surveying 2086 college students about the effect of COVID-19 on mental health in April 2020, they found the following:\n\n* 1 in 5 college students say their mental health has *significantly* worsened due to COVID-19\n* 80% of college students say COVID-19 has negatively impacted their mental health\n* 55% of college students would not know where to go if they or someone they knew needed mental health services right away\n\n## On-Campus Mental Health Resources: What\u2019s available?\n\nMany campuses will host students on campus and provide regular services again as everyone continues to get the vaccines available. But the delivery of mental health resources may vary, with many campuses offering telehealth services in addition to, or instead of, in-person appointments.\n\nIn general, though, most college campuses offer these mental health services:\n\n* consultations on academic issues or personal stressors\n* drop-in hours for students who really need to work through high stress or crisis situations\n* short-term individual therapy\n* group therapy (usually lasting six to eight weeks, or throughout the semester)\n* psychiatric care (on a case-by-case basis)\n* assistance with finding more permanent treatment providers (this service is known as care coordination)\n* coping skills workshops (to manage anxiety, stress, feelings of depression, etc.)\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what all your campus has to offer, use this campus mental health service search tool to find out (ulifeline.org/get\\_help\\_now).\n\n## How to Access On-Campus Mental Health Services\n\n## Drop-In Student Mental Health Services\n\nIf your campus has drop-in mental health services, then you don\u2019t need to schedule an appointment. All you have to do is walk into (or call) your campus wellness center during designated drop-in hours and ask to speak to someone about whatever\u2019s on your mind.\u00a0\n\nJust make sure to check your school\u2019s website to find out whether to physically go or call campus mental health services \u2014 social distancing policies are changing constantly.\u00a0\n\nSchools may also continue to offer telehealth services after COVID-19, so you could still have that option, if it\u2019s more convenient for you.\n\nUse drop-in mental health services when you:\n\n* are in a mental health crisis\n* need short term support as you work through distressing emotions\n* need help making a big decision (like whether to drop a class or move back home)\n\nOnce you are connected with a counseling professional, they will usually talk you through your situation and teach you some coping skills to handle distress in the future.\u00a0\n\nThey will talk to you for however long you need, but drop-in sessions usually last around an hour at most.\n\nThey may schedule an appointment to speak with you again, but usually drop-in appointments are one-and-done.\n\n## Therapy for College Students\n\nIf you have been experiencing intense sadness, nervousness, insomnia, anxiety, depression, irregular eating or exercise habits, or any other problems you would like long-term help with, you will have to schedule an intake appointment with a counseling professional to talk about getting more help.\n\nYou can find out how to schedule an appointment on your school\u2019s student affairs webpage. They will most likely require you to fill out some forms before your appointment. These usually include questions about your concerns and any previous mental/physical health problems you have faced.\n\nThey may ask you for insurance information. **If you don\u2019t have insurance, still schedule the campus intake appointment** and talk to your school about your options.\n\nDuring your appointment, you and a trained professional will decide how to meet your individual needs.\n\nYou may receive short-term individual therapy with someone on campus. Usually, counselors work with students for three to eight sessions to process short-term stressors.\u00a0\n\nYou may also be directed towards group therapy, which usually lasts 6-8 weeks. Groups may specialize in anxiety support, emotion management, substance use, graduate student issues, etc. These will vary by institution.\n\nHowever, if you need more long-term care, campus counselors may connect you to mental health professionals in your community. Counseling centers do this to keep clinicians available for other students who need them.\n\nYour counselor will draw up a list of providers in the community that accept your insurance (if you have any.) They will also help you email, call, and follow up if you are afraid to make the call, or forget to.\n\n## Psychiatric Services\n\nSome campuses have licensed psychiatrists available to prescribe medications for students who require them.\n\nIf you are not already taking medications to manage a mental illness, you may be able to set up an appointment with a campus psychiatrist.\n\nBut you may have to wait a while before you can get an appointment, as campus psychiatrists are in relatively high demand.\n\nCampus psychiatrists will most likely assist you in finding someone in the community to help you manage new medications.\n\n## Off-Campus Mental Health Resources for College Students\n\nWhen it comes to getting help, you aren\u2019t limited to what your campus can offer. You\u2019re also not limited to traditional mental health services.\n\n## Individual Services\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have a referral from someone on campus to meet with a professional in your area.\u00a0\n\nSearch for therapists, psychiatrists, treatment centers, and support groups using Psychology Today or Mental Health Match.\n\nYou can filter results by specialization, availability, gender, religion, sexuality, and treatment practice to find someone who:\u00a0\n\n* has experience treating your personal issues and/or mental illness\n* you are comfortable being around (e.g. a woman may prefer to have a woman for a therapist)\n* understands your values (e.g. your religion or philosophy)\n* has availability at the time you need it\n\nConsider your academic and biological schedule when you make your first appointment: are you able to consistently wake up in the morning? Are you sure you will always be available at the time you schedule your sessions for?\n\nMissed appointments don\u2019t usually get covered by insurance, and many professionals have a late fee, cancellation policy, etc. Be mindful of this when you schedule that first appointment.\n\n## Online Support Groups\n\nOnline support groups are widely available now, in part because of COVID-19. They offer access to support for people who usually can\u2019t afford to travel or pay for traditional therapy.\n\nThis is an extensive list of online support groups (mhanational.org/find-support-groups) from Mental Health America.\n\n## Self Care and Coping Skills Resources\n\nSelf care is any activity that you intentionally do to take care of your mental, physical, and/or emotional health. Practicing self care will help you manage your stress and calm yourself down when you need to.\n\nIt\u2019s not a replacement for professional help. But it can really improve your wellbeing if you incorporate self care into your routine.\n\nThis can be anything from a gentle walk, to doing something creative, to calling a friend just to talk.\n\nSelf care is not staying up late watching something on Netflix. It\u2019s more intentional and restorative than that.\n\n## COVID-19 Mental Health Resources\n\nThere are so many resources out there for students affected by COVID-19.\n\nThe Jed Foundation, which was founded by parents who lost their son to suicide, is dedicated to raising mental health awareness, suicide prevention, and providing mental health resources to young adults, especially college students.\n\nThey have provided a massive COVID-19 resource guide to help students cope throughout the pandemic.\n\nEven as things get back to normal, the coping skills you learn during a crisis like COVID-19 can be used for the rest of your life.\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019re going to be stressed over lots of things, so the skills never become irrelevant.\n\n## How to Manage Mental Illness While in College\n\n## Be proud of yourself.\n\nYou are handling school and your mental health, at the same time, and that\u2019s impressive! You\u2019re doing great things and you really should be proud of yourself.\n\n## Leave any embarrassment behind.\n\nIf you think you\u2019re the only student on campus struggling with mental illness, you\u2019re so wrong. 20% of college students have a diagnosable mental illness, remember?\n\nIt\u2019s normal to struggle, normal to ask for help, *and* normal to take medication for an illness. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nSo try as hard as you can to leave any shame or embarrassment you feel about your mental illness in the past.\n\n## Consider disability accommodations.\n\nWhile you absolutely can succeed in school with a mental illness, you probably need different things than your peers to reach that success.\n\nYour school (and the federal government) understands this, which is why disability accommodations exist. There are physical and mental disability accommodations available at every learning institution.\n\nMental health accommodations include, but are not limited to:\n\n* testing at an alternate location to minimize distractions\n* extra time to test, which helps minimize anxiety\n* an extended number of absences (within reason)\n* access to peer notes or audio recordings of notes\n* more time to complete assignments (within reason)\n* assistance with assignments and scheduling during hospitalization\n\nThese do not all apply in the remote learning setting, of course. Testing conditions, especially, have changed in the remote learning setting, for obvious reasons.\n\nStudents usually request and use accommodations if they are having trouble focusing, adjusting to new medications, or managing symptoms of a disorder (such as fatigue or insomnia.)\n\nStart by looking up your school\u2019s disability services department information. You will probably have to schedule an intake appointment with someone from the disability services department.\u00a0\n\nBefore your appointment, you will need to provide documentation of your disability, including:\n\n* the name of the professional who diagnosed you\n* any medications you are currently on\n* symptoms you are experiencing\n* prior hospitalizations due to your illness\n\nAt your appointment, they will ask what accommodations you think you need.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s probably not a great idea to go in and ask to never have to attend class or to be able to turn in any assignment late without discussing it with a professor first.\n\nBe reasonable with your requests.\u00a0\n\nYou will probably have a meeting with someone from disability resources every semester, so you can reevaluate accommodations as needed.\n\nIf you get accommodations for your disability, you do have to disclose the fact that you have a disability to any professor whose class you wish to use your accommodations in. The disclosure process is regulated by disability services.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you have a calculus class that tests.\u00a0\n\nYou have test anxiety, which is why you have testing accommodations like extra time and testing in a private room.\n\nIf you want to use your accommodations in this class, you have to tell them that you have a disability, and the accommodation, *but* you don\u2019t have to tell them that you have test anxiety.\n\nYou will most likely have an online account with disability services, where you can choose which professors and TAs to send disability/accommodation disclosure documents to.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n## Create an open line of communication with your professors and TAs.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to tell any professor anything specific about your mental illness.\n\nBut it can be helpful to tell them about any symptoms you may be experiencing, any problems you foresee in the future, and anything they can do to help.\n\nFor example, if you know that your depression gets worse in the winter, let your professors know ahead of time that you may have some difficulty getting to class on time or finishing assignments promptly.\n\nProfessors and TAs know how stressful college is, and if you don\u2019t use your illness a san excuse to procrastinate, then they will sympathize with you.\n\n## Manage medications (if you take any.)\n\nCollege is generally a little hectic and you\u2019ve probably got a lot going on right now.\n\nBut if you take medications for a mental illness, then making sure you get the right dose at the right time is your first priority, always.\n\nSet timers to remind yourself to take medications, pick up scripts, and go to appointments.\u00a0\n\nAsk roommates and parents to help you remember, if you need someone else to remind you.\n\n## Stick to a routine (seriously, it helps.)\n\nYou've heard it before, several times \u2014 eat, sleep, drink water, and study at regular intervals, and your life will really improve.\n\nBy now it almost sounds clich\u00e9, but a balanced routine (or as balanced as possible) can change your life.\n\nJust getting up in the morning and having a filling breakfast can make all the difference in your day.\u00a0\n\n## Get extra help with your courses when you need it.\n\nIf you notice that you\u2019re slipping up because you missed class or couldn\u2019t focus, take action now.\n\nGet a classmate or hire an affordable online tutor to work with you 1-on-1 in whatever subject you\u2019re struggling with.\u00a0\n\nMake sure to play catch up as soon as you notice you\u2019re slipping, so you don\u2019t fall even more behind.\n\n## Practice self-compassion.\n\nYou face different challenges than many of your peers. Even other people with the same mental illness struggle in unique ways.\n\nSo you\u2019re not all going to succeed on the same level and at the same pace.\n\nYou may not get fantastic grades if you have anxiety flare ups. You may not be very present in class if you\u2019re adjusting to new bipolar medication. You may have to take a semester off to get treatment for an eating disorder.\n\nAcknowledge the struggle, and be proud that you showed up to school in spite of it.\u00a0\n\nAnd know that you will succeed if you continue working on your mental health.\n\n## You can succeed, even if you\u2019re struggling right now.\n\nThousands of people with mental illness graduated last year. Thousands of students will do it this year.\n\nUse these mental health resources to take care of yourself, and you can be another person who graduates in spite of all the challenges that come with mental illness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo see my post with links to resources, you can visit my site [here](https://stellarlane.com/blog/mental-health-resources-in-college).",

        "post": "Hello, I am in my first year in grad school. I just finished my first semester with straight A's but it was done through heavy amounts of stress and pressure in the last minute. I am now in the beginning of my second semester and I already feel myself slowly slipping back to my unhealthy old habits. Like today, I slept in and just procrastinated by watching YouTube videos instead of doing homework. My first semester of grad school brought my depression and anxiety back to surface (I am back on medication now) I actually quit my job to pursue my master's degree and I live with my family now. In undergrad, I would go to school and go to work on the weekends. Now that I don't have any work I am constantly surrounded by what I am studying including weekends. Its not that I don't like what I'm studying but I don't like having it around me 24/7 (is that weird?). Even though I didn't like my old job, it was actually my only source of a \"social life\". I don't exactly have a social life outside my family. I also honestly miss making my own money and hate asking my parents for money. Ugh maybe I'm overthinking everything, but I could really use some advice.",

I now feel the exact opposite energy when it comes to writing, partially because we didn\u2019t get the results we were hoping for and the gene I was studying had no effect.\n\nThis is not motivating me to write at all, I had plenty of time, especially now with the current COVID-19 situation I had my other study related plans postponed.

        "post": "I've always struggled with procrastination in my undergrad. And I felt that if I got to do what I was passionate about I wouldn't find it so hard to be motivated. I'm in my dream research lab and program, I have the most caring and supportive PI a grad student could ask for, and amazing ppl to work with and my work is truly fascinating. I was incredibly lucky to get here. I've failed courses in my UG and my GPA was below the minimum but grad school gave me a chance. I am happy and grateful. And yet I constantly struggle to find the motivation to feel like doing work and I keep putting off things. I don't understand it, I really love what I do. I'm good at writing and presenting and reading papers is literally my favourite thing about research. I have accomplished some things, I have random spurts of productivity and I would stay up all night when those times hit. This year was really sucky my mental health was probably at its lowest with family issues and catching covid. But i keep screwing myself over and I dont know how to overcome this disconnect.\n\nWhenever I'm thinking about how much work I should be doing I kind of just enter a freeze, I could stare at my phone for hours while I have a mental battle with my mind to open my computer. This makes me incredibly depressed and I cry hating myself. I get mad at myself because I've missed important deadlines this year. I should've had no problem with transferring to the PhD program (almost at the end of my Msc timeline) but because so much was overdue the department is saying no. i've put my PI in a tough spot because they still believe in me and support me continuing work in their lab. I feel like my academic future is hanging in the balance and it's my fault. And if I can't overcome this then do I even deserve to be here? Does anyone else experience this? How do you overcome those lowest and worst times? I'm still trying and I just really want to overcome it because it just doesn't make sense.",

        "post": "Hello everyone,\n\nsorry in advance if this is against the sub's rules in some form, even more so sorry in advance for the textwall and my English, since I'm not a native speaker.\n\nI decided to unblock reddit on my two seperate programs to block distracting websites and tell my very personal story about extreme procastination to whoever the hell is interested. Maybe some of y'all can relate or throw in a word of advice or whatever you feel like.\n\nI'm currently sitting here and will have to write my master thesis within the next 24 days, I have roughly 50 pages more to go - I have 7 so far that I wrote in the last days. I know it is probably possible to finish it in time but I'm in a state of total anxiety about not getting it done, having to physically force myself to even look at my paper because of the anxiety level.\n\nI thought I was at a point in my life where that wouldn't happen to me anymore. I thought I had become more mature. I thought I had learned something. Well, here is my story of extreme procastination.\n\n\\---------------------------\n\nSo, I've been procrastinating since high school and continuned well into undergrad. I've written papers on the last few days, studied the night before the exam, all the good stuff that is somewhat accepted among students and always makes up for a good story. I once asked if I could use the bathroom and did the presentation that I had to give in the same class. Probably the teacher thought I was taking a dump. Write 15 pages on a weekend, deadline being on a friday, handing it in on monday, \"it's easier to ask for forgiveness that for permission\". At one point, I was even known for being that guy that would go to a party on a saturday and hand in an A on monday with the smirk of an arrogant dick. It was chronic but with an optimistic attitude and it did work quite well, to be honest. I spend a year abroad, did interships and still graduated in time and with good grades (I'm European but it translates to a 3.8 or 3.9 gpa in the US I believe). The bachelor thesis was a massive pain and total panic write but I ultimately somehow made it through. \n\nThen I decided to start a 2-years master in my field with the intention of going into academia because I was geniuely passionate about my field. That's were it all went down. I started right before covid. Most of the professors of my university basically decided that because of covid, they wouldn't take deadlines too serious anymore. You can imagine what that plus the complete lack of social spaces does to an extroverted chronic procrastinator. Two semesters of extreme procastination followed, so extreme, that it let me spiral into a deep hole of depression and anxiety. I would spend months getting up every morning, tell myself I will panic write that paper that was due a month ago and just sit all infront of the computer, doing nothing. I was used to ALWAYS getting things done, now that was not the case anymore. There were other bad things happening in my life as well, things I could tell my friends, family or professors but it was the procrastination, I know that, which let me reach a rock bottom I've never seen before in my life. \n\nSo, I went into therapy. Finally managed to decide to just tell all the professors who's papers I've never submitted that I will never submit them. Quitted the stressful TA job. Moved in back with my parents to take a break, worked for a month in a grocery store, took a few weeks vacaction and got back into uni in the fall of 2021 with a fresh start. With a new support system and completly not caring about the time it would take me anymore (uni is free here, it's \"just\" bad for your CV to take 4 year for a 2 years masters) by spring this year my last class was done.\n\nThen I had to face my arch-enemy, the devil's paper, the absolute object of procastination. There was an 8-page essay (yes, you heard correctly e i g h t pages) that I didn't submit for 2 and half years. It was the last thing that lacked to register my thesis and take my final exam. The essay was on my to-do-list for like a year, like literally in my room physically written, then I decided to just remove it for less anxiety, to later put it back on. I couldn't bring myself to ask if it was ok to still submit it, simply because I thought it is insanley ridiculous and embarassing to my bones. I then wrote this thing with trebbling hands, dated it back about 1 1/2 years, and told my professor - who was also my former boss and thankfully thought highly of me - that I was to ashamed to ask her if I can still submit it. Boom, she accepted it and felt invincible. \n\nI thought I finally had overcome it! Finally won! I took a short vacation, then studied and ace'd my finals and \"\"started working\"\" on my thesis. And that's about where I am now. This was in June/July. Four months of minimal work passed, two of those with going to the library five days a week with maybe 3 or 4 real work hours per week - I know it is insane. I read books, hit the gym, worked odd jobs, hell, I even started writing short stories and tried painting. With genuine happiness slowly but steadily transfering into more and more anxiety - who doesn't know the process? And all that while initally feeling the best I've felt in a long time. If there was no thesis - I'm would be on a good way.\n\n\\-------------------------------------\n\nTLDR: Procastination. A lot of it. I salute everyone that wants to do their PhD or go into academia. I'm not strong enough. Weither I make it or not, this will be my last month in this state of mind. I will get a normal job, any job, where I physically am not allowed to procastinate. But seriously, my respect has grown so much for all of you who get through this.\n\nIf I do finish this thesis, I've decided today to open up a website or something for emotional support for chronically procastinating people in my country. Volunteer-based obivously. Just someone that you can write to, that can help you from an outside perspective because they really, really know how that shit feels like and how it works. I feel like this is deeply needed.",

        "post": "Hey friends. I could really use some advice. (TLDR at end.) I'm 3.5 years into my Masters (friggin yikes) in Archaeology and nowhere near done writing my thesis. Trying to work on it during Covid levelled me, tranquilized me. There were many days that I didn't get up out of bed, weeks that I didn't even open a word document to work on. My procrastination was next-level. I eventually got the help I needed in the form of counselling and the right medication. I heavily considered taking a leave of absence, but never took the plunge. I have a lot of regrets over not pursuing that leave, but there's nothing I can do about that now.\n\nI'm now at the point where my advisor is clearly very upset with my progress. In fact, she's upset about everything I do. I told her last year that I wasn't doing well, but I was taking the steps I needed to to get better. She didn't know the extent of the troubles I was having, and that's on me for not bringing them fully to her attention. But we're now at a place where I'm clearly a disappointment. I have toyed with the idea of leaving my Masters since early 2020, but again, never took the plunge. I am so far into this shit show at this point and I don't know what to do. It's put serious strain on my relationship with my partner and heck, my relationship with myself. I miss the person I used to be. My decision to go to grad school, perhaps specifically this program with this advisor, has been my biggest regret.\n\nI have an amazing job in my field (that doesn't require a Masters) and they can't wait for me to defend so I can work full-time. (I'm currently working alternate weeks.) I'm scared my boss will see me differently if I bring up the idea of quitting. It's a small company and everyone is really great, but I don't want to let anyone down. I'm also sick of putting on this charade, that I'm confident I'll finish soon, and competent enough to do so.\n\nIf anyone has been in this situation, or is currently in the thick of it, I'd love to hear from you. What are your thoughts? What did you decide? What helped you make the decision? How do you deal with the shame from friends, family, partners, yourself?\n\n(I've written some form of this post a few times in the past year and a half, but heyo, procrastination.)\n\nTLDR: I'm 3.5 years into my Masters and have no motivation to finish it. I have a great job in my field that doesn't require a Masters. I don't know what to do. Any advice is appreciated.",

I tend to procrastinate a lot and that keeps building guilt and pressure. Finally, I broke the ongoing procrastination mode/ episode and decided to work sincerely today. However, I am feeling quite stressed with the transition ( to the sincere, non - procrastination mode). Not procrastinating means taking the challenges head on which brings lots of anxious emotions. I am feeling quite anxious today. Naturally, to avoid the anxious emotions, I tend to procrastinate. What have you done to come out of the cycle? I also have history of mental health conditions ( generalized and social anxiety). I was on Lexapro for a number of years and then switched to venlafaxine which I took for two to three years. However, I decided to taper it off and did so successfully about three months ago. (I gave my first seminar while I was off medicine and did okay although there was some anticipatory anxiety). I wanted to see if I can function without antidepressants. I also feel that no matter, what medicine I was on, there were episodes of anxiety from time to time. I can tell from experience that if I  keep procrastination in control, and work consistently,  I can keep things in control...much easier said than done. Please share your thoughts and share if you got through the same. \nI feel so relaxed already penning the thoughts down.

I realized I got to a point where the day OF one of my classes final papers was due I stated the assignment (the liar in my head that says \u201cah I work well under pressure or ah I can do it last minute and still get a good grade\u201d) not anymore. I waited and waited for who knows what to start that assignment and I had the worst time of my life. I\u2019m traumatized. I was so stressed out finals week that I threw up from nausea, had major major anxiety, pretty much broke down half way and started ending my sentences midway because I just could not keep going for the life of me. That level of stress was traumatic and I know it\u2019s my fault. I need to make changes. I promised myself if I did that to myself again I would drop out. And since I have Qualifying exams this semester, I\u2019m like SpongeBobs brain, all chaos. All I can think about are my professors thinking \u201chow did she get in with this work? Or just thinking the worst of my capabilities. Which I also feel like I\u2019ve partly lost. My writing was so good before, now it\u2019s hard to make a sentence sound good enough. I bombed those finals so hard, when I think about it I get anxiety again. I feel kinda numb too, I\u2019m worried that I didn\u2019t really panic knowing those papers were due that day. Not panicking means I\u2019m not caring anymore and that\u2019s scaring me. Factors like being far away from home and being lonely in a new city with no real friends, mental health struggles, and life in general has been bumpy for all of us the last two years. Have any of you experienced this stress trauma before? How have you dealt with it? Or if you have any tips on being productive and avoid procrastinating please let me know. I\u2019m desperate. I don\u2019t want to end up hating my career bc of grad school. I LOVE what I do, I love being an archaeologist, I can\u2019t see myself doing anything other than that. Which is why dropping out of grad school is NOT a choice. I have to finish, but I need help managing it all along the way. Thanks in advance.",

        "title": "After months of hard work on myself, my PI noticed and was proud of my improved mental health and productivity",
        "post": "Hey, PhD student in biology in the US here. About 6 months ago, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/t5zcym/psa_worklife_balance_isnt_just_about_time_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in r/PhD concerning the importance of having an identity outside of your research, or in my case, the lab. This was when I was struggling the most with depression resulting from a traumatic social experience within my cohort. It unfortunately leaked over into my lab life since some of my colleagues are the very same ones that were part of that trauma. I was and am still in therapy, but having to face my demons each day in the lab impacted my mood, my productivity, and my resistance to burnout. **To be specific, I was struggling with feeling like I wasn't achieving enough, as well as feeling incredibly isolated and lonely.** And 6 months ago, I bawled my eyes out over Zoom to my slightly taken aback but very supportive advisor.\n\n6 months later, I'm happy to report that although the journey is still continuing, I'm in a much better place. My mood, and subsequently my productivity and resilience, are all higher. And recently, during our quarterly progress meeting, my PI told me that he's proud of the progress and the improvement I've made, and that the change is like night and day. **Looking back, here are the practical changes that I think helped the most:**\n\n**1) Setting small, achievable goals**. My PI and I realized earlier this year that I was getting down on myself since I felt like I wasn't getting things done, and that I was getting overwhelmed by multiple arms of my projects. We started regular individual development plan meetings (every 3 months) to set goals for my skill improvements and specific project goals (experiments) for me to focus on for the next 3 months, in an effort to boost my confidence and my productivity. It worked. I got lucky and my PI suggested the plan, but if you feel similarly unfocused and unaccomplished, please consider asking your PI about starting a plan system to help prioritize and set goals. There are times that you have to advocate for yourself to be efficient and figure out what works best for you.\n\n**2) Advocating for myself socially**. I forced myself out of my comfort zone, socially, over and over, to try and build a support network independent of my own program and cohort. I play an instrument, so I joined my school ensemble and networked my way into another couple in the city. I joined a club that manages a farm share to meet new people. I initiated so many awkward conversations, but some of them went better than I expected. I ended up meeting other people, now friends, who I have shared interests with!\n\n**3) Investing in my hobbies**. You do have time. My belief is that if you're spending more than 8-10 hours in the lab every day to get your shit done and it's not because the protocol calls for it, then you're being inefficient. I aggressively planned my days in blocks of time due to 1) and pushed myself to say yes to committing time to hobbies. Your hobbies will give you that sense of accomplishment and value when your work does not, which is what I was alluding to in my original post. Making progress in my weightlifting and music performance has been absolutely invaluable to keeping my morale up and giving me things to look forward to after I'm done in the lab for the day.\n\nThe last item is not a practical change, but a mindset change that I'm still working on especially with the help of my therapist. I'm relearning to trust in the goodness of other people and to not be so harsh on myself. I have good days and bad days, but recently the good have outnumbered the bad, which is a nice change.\n\nSo there you have it! I wanted to share a success story that is honestly still being written, if only to encourage people that it's possible to feel better even with obstacles that feel insurmountable in grad school.",

Please note that this is my own experience, but hopefully it can help someone who is going through something similar.\n\nTW: Talks about depression and anxiety\n\nI'm really sorry it's so long, but TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nI (F25) started my full-time MA Sept 2020, during peak lockdown and restrictions in the UK. I'd moved back home because of Covid, and had taken the chance to do my PostGrad. Everything was online and I only went to campus once to collect student ID. \n\nThe first term went well, the second term not so much, but my department was super helpful with applying for extensions and self-certification to coursework. My problem was procrastination and feeling overwhelmed and apathetic towards work, and I had multiple things going on in my personal life which did not help. However, I kept extending until I couldn't anymore and applied for an interruption.\n\nGot part-time work in my field, started counselling and working out, and enjoyed my time without studying, and re-joined April 2022. Thought I just needed a break, but everything came back and hit me like a ton of bricks when I came back. I struggled with completing the rest of my assignments, leaving only one more and the dissertation left. \n\nMy dissertation hand in date was supposed to be today, and I just want to share with you an email I sent my counsellor today (Thursday) about the progress I have taken in the past month (she's currently away on leave). Please be kind.\n\n\\[Names are not used, and BF = Boyfriend\\]\n\n\\-\n\n\"Hi \\[Name\\],\n\nI know that you\u2019re still on holiday and that our next session is next week, but a lot has happened this past month, so I think I\u2019ll quickly fill you in beforehand.\n\nShort story: I\u2019ve been diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder and am currently on a low-dose medication to help treat it. I\u2019ve also decided to change my postgraduate qualification to a PG Dip instead.\n\nLong story: (I\u2019ll break it into sections aha)\n\n**Uni called me**\n\nMy Uni\u2019s Student Wellbeing and Mental Health department called me last Friday because I hadn\u2019t been responding to my department\u2019s emails. \n\nI\u2019d basically blocked everything out to do with the last assignment and dissertation again, and I almost didn\u2019t pick up the second time they called me, but I forced myself to because I knew that if I didn\u2019t then I\u2019d basically go down the same route as last year.\n\nI was immediately emotional and was crying throughout the call, but the lady who I talked to was very kind and understanding. She explained options I could take and recommended me to apply for a SoRA, their disability rota which can help with extensions and examinations. \n\nIt needed a GP\u2019s referral letter, but she placed me on it temporarily until I could get it so I could get the benefits immediately. \n\nBasically, everything happened after that, I called the GP to book a mental health appointment, but the receptionist (who was very kind and made sure I was okay and safe whilst I was blubbing) recommended to call back on Tuesday morning because of the bank holiday weekend. This is so I could book an emergency same day appointment which would have a better chance of me hearing from a GP than a pre-booked one.\n\n**Mum**\n\nI then talked to Mum and had a mental breakdown. She was quite tough with me, and immediately went down the route of offering strict solutions. I think one the one things I struggled with what she said was that she had been hurt when she had attempted to help previously, but I\u2019d shut her down, so now that I was being honest with her and wanting help, she was going to offer solutions.\n\nI guess I was surprised she was hurt, but explained why I didn\u2019t tell her (guilt, shame from being judged etc.). It was tough, but she was really supportive. \n\nMy parents agreed to pretty much handhold me through this and organised a study bootcamp for me from Saturday onwards. Mum also said she\u2019ll always help me with tidying my room whenever I need and checks in with it every day. My cousin and Uncle are over from Hong Kong because she\u2019s going to Uni here, so I went out one last time with her and had a bunch of fun before the bootcamp. \n\n**Studying Bootcamp**\n\nBootcamp was/is hard. Mum\u2019s waking me up at 8am everyday so I have a routine and to help fix my sleep schedule, which immediately went haywire once I stopped working at the library. I was only falling asleep at 5/6am and getting up early afternoon. \n\nI\u2019m on a strict electronics schedule, with my dad having my phone \u2013 I\u2019m only allowed it on breaks and have to give it back before I go to bed. I still have my iPad and have been taking it with me, but I should leave it downstairs with my laptop since I use it for studying. \n\nI changed my study space to the downstairs dining table so I can be around people, and they can hold me accountable, I have noise cancelling headphones and always listen to music anyway. \n\nThe weekend was draining, but in two days I got all my research done. Then I found out about the extensions and PGDip and realised I could work on the essay till Fri, and scheduled it that way, and have currently completed half of the essay, with the aim to have most of it done today and complete it tomorrow morning. \n\nIt\u2019s been going well so far, and I really appreciate what my folks are doing for me. My issue with Dad and his tidiness comes up a bit, and we clash, but we always make up after, especially now that I\u2019m doing this bootcamp.\n\n**PGDip and extensions**\n\nMy programme director contacted me once the SoRA application went through last Fri and went through my extension options for my dissertation and assignment. \n\nShe also mentioned that I could still graduate with a PGDip, which is an equivalent qualification and accreditation to the Masters, but without the dissertation. I knew about the PGDip but didn\u2019t realise that was an option at \\[my Uni\\] and thought it would\u2019ve been too late to change. \n\nAfter talking to my parents and a Zoom meeting with \\[Programme Director\\], I\u2019ve decided to go down that route because I can\u2019t handle the stress the dissertation brings me, and just knowing I don\u2019t have to do it has brought a huge weight off my shoulders. \n\nIt also motivates me to finish this even more now, since I don\u2019t worry about having done all this progress for nothing. I now only have to finish this assignment by tomorrow (that\u2019s when the extension I recently applied for runs out) and then I\u2019m finished. I\u2019m halfway there and plan to finish it by tomorrow morning.\n\nI still need to formally change qualifications, but \\[Programme Director\\] told me she\u2019ll contact the administrator to help me through the steps.\n\n**GP**\n\nOn Tuesday morning I had to get up early so I could call the GP by 8am. Mum came in to wake me up at 7.30, but I knew I could get ready in 15 mins, so I snoozed by alarm for another 15 mins. Mum blew up at me for breaking the schedule she set; she wanted me to be disciplined enough to have plenty of time to get ready. \n\nI was still in bed and had just woken up, so I was feeling emotionally and physically tired and really didn\u2019t take it well. I was emotional for the call to the GP, and the receptionist told me to expect a call back from the GP sometime throughout the morning. Mum apologised to me after. \n\nThe doctor who is looking after me is \\[Name\\], and she was really lovely when I talked to her. I mentioned all the stress and anxiety I\u2019d had since lockdown, my counselling with you, the unmotivated and overwhelming feelings towards the Masters. \n\nI also asked about how to start the process of a referral for an ADHD because there is family history of depression and ADHD (Mum told me my Gran had depression all the time between Grandad\u2019s death and her death. I hadn\u2019t realised, but it makes sense now). \n\nI also told her about Uni\u2019s SoRA scheme and needing the referral letter, and she agreed to send one to me. I was clearly emotional throughout the call, and it was kind of tough to hear some of the things she was saying, but I\u2019m glad I went through it.\n\nShe offered me medication for the anxiety and depression, which I accepted, and started taking a low dosage of it yesterday. \n\nI\u2019m still getting used to it, and I can only describe it like having a double/triple espresso after an all-nighter, but without the jitteriness. I haven\u2019t noticed any other side effects yet, but it\u2019s only been a couple days.\n\n I now have to wake up in the morning to take it, so I guess there\u2019s the routine and there goes my love for sleeping in.\n\n**ADHD**\n\nI have a questionnaire to fill out and send off to my GP, and I need to get some supporting evidence from other people who know me well, so they also have a questionnaire to fill out. I\u2019ve given one to my Mum, and one to my undergrad Uni friend (she knows all about my studying habits). \n\nI\u2019m not sure about giving one to \\[BF\\]. On the one hand, he\u2019s been with me throughout a difficult time and has been absolutely amazing and supportive (I\u2019ve told him about everything in this email and he\u2019s very understanding even though I can\u2019t message/talk to him as much until this is over), and therefore knows I will need this referral. \n\nBut on the other hand, I\u2019ve only been with him for just over a year now, but I don\u2019t know if that gives him enough time to grasp all ADHD symptoms like knowing me throughout Uni would. If that makes sense. I\u2019m leaning towards giving him one, and he\u2019ll be staying over for a few days over the weekend so he can easily travel for work, so I can ask him then.\n\nI was also wondering if I could also give the supporting questionnaire to you to fill out? I feel like I\u2019ve opened up a lot to you over the past year or so, and you were the one to first bring up that I was showing symptoms for ADD. \n\nIf you need any additional payments to complete the form, I\u2019d be more than happy to cover the cost. I\u2019ve attached it to the email for you to have a look over, and I\u2019d be happy to talk more about it on Tuesday.\n\nThat\u2019s where I\u2019m up to now! Everything happened in the last week, but I feel like I\u2019m already in a better headspace. Sorry if it\u2019s a lot to read, but please enjoy the rest of your time off, and I shall update you on Tuesday!\n\nAll the best,\n\nXeranthe.\"\n\n\\-\n\nI hope this process can help someone who feels like they can't reach out to their university or department. Their support really helped me and pushed me in the right direction. \n\nWishing you guys all the best out there.\n\n\\-\n\n**TL;DR:** \n\nI sought out help after being contacted by my Uni's Student Wellbeing department. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder and am currently on a low-dose medication to help treat it. I\u2019ve also decided to change my postgraduate qualification to a PG Dip instead to take stress away from doing a dissertation, and have had great support from my Uni to do so. The process is talked about in the above text.",

        "post": "Hi all. First semester US PhD student here. I was direct admit from undergrad so it's been kind of a culture shock. I'll try to keep it short: basically this is by far the most sedentary I've been in my entire life. I'm not any kind of fitness guru, but before this semester started I feel like I was able to exercise at least 3 times a week (and I worked full time in undergrad so the busyness isn't the problem). I'm fully funded so don't have a job, and am struggling so hard to force myself out of my tiny apartment to exercise and work in cafes even though I moved to the city so they'd be walking distance from me. I think more than anything the overwhelm of an entirely new environment with new people has been really draining me and my work life balance has become awful. \n\nMy program is really reading heavy (duh) and writing heavy (duh) and it's constantly weighing on me even when I'm not actively doing work. I have that awful kind of ADHD where I'm glued to the bed/couch when procrastinating my work because \"I can't do anything, I have to do this assignment.. which I'll start in 3 hours.\" I'm medicated, take adderall on days I have to do work (which is most of them, especially rn). My executive function is still shit and it takes me at least an hour to convince myself to start work. Honestly I think the meds might be making the couch-gluing worse, on days I dont take it I go on walks during the day and get out of the house. But that might just be because those are days I give myself permission to be \"off the clock\" so I can go out and do stuff. The fact that the sun is setting early and I love to be outside is making it harder too; by the time I'm finished with my tasks it's dark outside and I don't want to go out. I'm just seeking advice from anyone who's been in my position, feels like they can't do anything til their work is done, but can't make themselves start work. Should I suck it up and work out at night? Force myself into a walk in the park first thing in the morning? I typically only exercise outdoors. I'm at the end of my rope and hoping to reset some habits during winter break. I know I have the ability to manage exercise with the rest of my life, I've done it before. I used to do yoga and meditate every day, used to walk a few miles a day at least. Now I wake up, pop an addy, hit my vape, and lay in bed feeling bad about myself until panic sits in and I move to the couch to do schoolwork. (yes I know I need to quit vaping. Hoping to attempt that over winter break too.) Next thing I know it's night time, I've barely eaten, and it's another groundhog day of fuckin nothin on the books. I've regressed so badly this semester and my mental health is suffering. Any advice from literally anyone is so appreciated. \n\nTL;DR: I need to get up and moving every day but it's so hard with debilitating ADHD. My mental health is suffering significantly as a result and I need advice. Or even just kind words. Grad school has physically depressed me.\n\nEDIT; thank you everyone for your kind responses!! i\u2019ve never posted in here and it seems like a great supportive community. the immense kindness yall are showing literally made me cry, thank you, i really needed to hear some of this. \nmy favorite suggestion by far is building in exercise as a non-negotiable schedule block. it\u2019ll take some mental fortitude but i\u2019m gonna try to do it. i think it\u2019ll be the best option for how my brain works specifically. \notherwise, i\u2019ve tried speechify and other voice to text apps. actually BOUGHT an entire year of speechify in august bc i was so optimistic. turns out the AI snoop dogg doesn\u2019t know how to skip over graphs, parenthetical citations, footnotes, or page numbers, making him pretty unintelligible. interested in seeing if i can figure out a way around this, but so far, speechify was a bust for me. \ni\u2019m also gonna look into a walking pad. i\u2019m broke right now but once i can afford it i think it\u2019s a great idea. TV is my procrastination tool of choice, so if i can make it a little more enjoyable with walking, i\u2019d love to try! \nit\u2019s baby steps. eventually i\u2019d love to join a fitness class on campus or otherwise, but i\u2019m gonna try some more accessible things first (i miss going to yoga every week lol). again, thank u all, ur suggestions have been so useful and the support means a lot.

        "post": "Hello my fellow procrastinators,\n\nFor one of my classes, we have to come up with a proposal for a research project about microbial physiology. The project won't be done in real life, it's just proposal in the standard NSF format (background, methods, intellectual merit, etc.). It includes a presentation (November 20th), a written proposal (November 27th) and an oral defense (December 3rd). I really want to get the written portion at least 95% done by the 20th so that I can enjoy Thanksgiving break at home. \n\nI'm most anxious about the presentation because I think it's the most important part. The project was technically assigned the first week of October, but due to a depressive spiral and need to focus on exams, I put off starting the project until now.  It's been hanging over my head for weeks, but my mental health was so all over the place I couldn't focus on it. With the deadline looming, I am absolutely freaked out. I have a general topic I want to pursue, but I'm running out of time. Older grad students say it's not as bad as you expect (the oral defense is conversational, they didn't even get a grade back for the written portion, etc.). Even a professor I spoke to said they just want to see you think like a PhD student. But even with all these caveats, I am shaking in my boots and unsure if I can \"think like a PhD student.\"\n\nEssentially I think I'm asking, \"am I screwed?\" This project is the only thing I have to worry about/focus on now (I've spoken with my advisors, and they've allowed me to take a break from research to finish the semester strong). Are procrastination and slap-jobs common in grad school? If anyone has any advice about procrastination, motivation, and just finishing the semester, I'd really appreciate it.",

I\u2019m on the younger side, mind you, but I feel the same way even about those closer in age to me. Their research is excellent, they (seemingly) coast through coursework I struggle with, and juggle side projects and other external stuff to boot.\n\nIt\u2019s worse because, as opposed to undergrad, my insecurities are beginning to effect the quality of my work.

        "post": "I have been struggling to finish writing my thesis as writing to me is the most difficult part of the whole thing. I have been awarded a dissertation completion grant, which is money to allow me to keep writing, provided I complete by Dec 31st. Given that I am here on reddit talking to you all instead of writing you can see that is not going so well. All the hard work I have put in so I can make something of myself is paying off. I have a job interview on Thursday that I am pretty confident about, which will be the last piece I need to live my dream of moving out into an apartment with my partner and leading a happy life. Everything hinges on me just putting the work in and finishing my thesis by the end of the year. Now finishing, which is entirely possible, becomes less possible everyday I don't accomplish much, and the last 5 days have been just that. I have always been a procrastinator often finishing things at the last minute or taking a few extra minutes than I was given, like they say if your likable and do good quality work a lack of punctuality will be forgiven. This time, though, I need to finish on time, and I have enough time to do everything I need to with enough advanced warning and everyone in my life supporting me, including my Supervisors/PI. Why then am I making this so difficult? Why does every minute just feel like absolute torture, and why do I allow myself to stand in my own way? Did anyone else feel the same sort of writing block? How did you push through it? I'm running out of time to be struggling so hard to get myself to work. How did you finally get yourself to sit down, shut up and do it? I know the whole thing seems so self inflicting and whiny, which is what makes the whole thing more confusing since I am usually the person who says get over yourself and do what needs to be done. I apologize for the ranty nature of this post but it feels good to get it out. Hopefully a run will clear my head and get me going on my goals for the day.",

It seems more-or-less frowned-upon to take more courses than needed, and instead do research full-time.  \n\nWhy not allow some more courses, say 1 or 2 per semester, and spend the remaining part of each semester on research?  That is, to run the two parallel to avoid focusing too hard on the research, which seems like a brain fogginess/procrastination/happiness issue.  I would want to take courses outside deeper in my specialty and even outside my specialty or department, and have a more steady, gradual pace towards research.  Overall, I would end up learning much more, and would even do better-quality research.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you all so much for the feedback!  As I've said, a PhD is clearly for research, but I am concerned about some things I have observed regarding well-roundedness.  Also, the fact that I am going into a mathematical discipline makes this an especially interesting discussion. :D",

        "post": "Hi everyone, \n\nSorry if this comes off partially as a rant or emotional post - not my intention to but I have no one else to speak with at the moment and everything just feels terrible. \n\nI'm currently in my second year of grad school in a STEM field. I always thought I wanted to pursue research and it was one of my motivating factors all throughout my undergrad. And when I finally got here, it was a huge relief. The only thing is, I guess after the years of being here, maybe the burnout is becoming a reality. For me, my biggest regret is finishing my Bachelor's, working/volunteering in my lab for a year, and then starting grad school right away. The last time I even remember having a week off is either around Christmas or last summer...both times weren't even that relaxing cause I had mental breakdowns prior and/or had to spend it with family and that was stressful. \n\nI just don't understand how people can consistently find happiness or work life balance. Every time I feel like I make a bit of progress I just experience a setback of sorts and I feel like I'm back at square one. It's not that experiments, etc. aren't working but every so often, I get hit with feelings of doom and anxiety and incompetence. \n\nDespite doing pretty well (I've co-authored and published a couple papers in the past couple of years, and have won many awards), I just feel like a complete fraud. I've always been able to keep imposter syndrome at bay since with my \"incompetence\" as a grad student, I often viewed it with a more positive/humbling twist than anything (eg. I would think, okay I don't know everything and that's completely okay.) but I feel like a lot of these feelings have sort of morphed into something more negative lately (eg. What do people see in me, I don't deserve these things, there are better students than me). \n\nI guess what sucks is that I am in a lab of post docs who know what they're doing/have families so I feel like I relate to nobody and I'm left comparing myself to people who have ~6-8 years of experience...which of course is completely unfair but I can't help it. I don't know. I know everyone worries about their future and stuff but I just don't know how to keep myself feeling sane. I just find myself procrastinating more and more and even the simplest of tasks take me hours to complete. I just feel very overwhelmed. \n\nIt sucks because I still have to come in and put on a tough face and suck it all up but as soon as everyone leaves or I'm at home by myself I just end up sitting around crying and staying up until absurd hours not doing anything or sleeping because the anxiety just keeps you up. \n\nI know there is probably no easy answer to this and the most logical thing would be to just go see someone or ask for a break or something. But I guess when it feels like you've been doing nothing, a break feels undeserved even though it shouldn't be the case, but you just get incredibly overwhelmed with feelings of guilt. Like I feel like I'm being hit with so many different emotions right now that I just cannot process anything and all I can do it sit around and feel terrible and cry. I've tried to keep myself busy with other interests but just recently, I realize that maybe I've been ignoring my actual mental state via distractions more than anything. \n\nSorry this isn't much of a question really. I guess I've been feeling pretty bad/lonely and have no one else to mention it to. Thanks. \n\n\n",

It was unhealthy. I burned out. Negative data made me bitter and sad.\n\nMy last year I slowed down quite a bit, partly due to burn out, partly due to lack of excitement about pathways my project ended up moving towards. Now my problem is not working too hard+not smart but quite the opposite - keeping myself from working too little. I go into lab at 10 and leave at 3 saying I will write when I get home and end up napping or watching Netflix. Procrastination and guilt are consuming me. \n\nTLDR: Worked too much before and it was unhealthy, now as a 4th year working at sloth pace. Wtf is going on?\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Were you able to pick yourself up by the bootstraps to finish it? I know I will be able to , but the battle right now seems to only be starting and I\u2019m trying to not let final years **panic** be the only driving force to defend and graduate.\n\nThanks!",

Last semester was a wreck; I left a toxic PI and this semester even more so after finding another fit.\n\nI have so much crap to do; midterm in a few days in which I am anxious about, reading papers and getting acquainted with the field for my new advisor, massive course assignments and TAing/grading. I'm barely keeping things afloat. On top of it, I'm stuck in my apartment due to this corona business. I'm one of those people (and probably there are quite a few here from the looks of it) who just cannot work productively at home. For the last 3 days, I put in about 2 hours per day tops and I am ashamed of myself. I have to meet my advisor, maintain their expectations and do all this other crap. It's just fucking hard being stuck in my apartment all the time. Procrastination is like a drug, it gives you comfort for a few hours max and then it hits you like a ton of bricks. Doesn't help that I have symptoms of insomnia as well; if I try to go to bed at 12 am sometimes I just can't sleep until around 3~4 am and then wake up at like 1 pm. I just feel... sad; like there's no hope for me, that I'm going to fail.\n\nHow do you guys manage?",

        "post": "_Kinda venting myself in the example of having seen others do similarly here, so if you don't care, you can just skip this._\n\nSo my little story is this: depressive (tho not diagnosed) childhood and teens, socially bankrupt (i.e. left my friends because my circles were _truly_ toxic) at my early 20s but slowly rebuilding, but then troubles like death of my dad, and other health issues in my immediate family messed that up, so mid-20s I basically didn't have a social life (kinda skipped a couple years here and there in uni, so a couple yrs older than my peers). Still managed to graduate with a great GPA, decided to change tracks for my MA, and sunk a whole year in to basically studying and studying.\n\nAt the end of spring 2019 I had a shit ton of plans. Applied to a bunch of MA programs, accepted to half, a lot of travelling and fun meanwhile. Nice times. Joy and success. At the end of the summer I had registered at the best uni in my country (not that highly ranked internationally but still), moved out for the first time, got me a nice little apartment at the city centre like I'd always dreamt. All fine and dandy.\n\nNow I thought it was the time to fix all that bs that remained from my shitty teens. I hadn't travelled much, hadn't had friends, and let me be honest, hadn't had a gf yet, even. The loss of my dad kinda numbed me to the world for a bunch of years, so couldn't do anything about fixing this stuff back then, and here I was a 26yo but I had confidence, and I had the will. Besides, I'd dealt with my depression and introversion in that six years. I had become (and still am, tbh) a bloke that's happy on the inside, at peace with himself. But I wanted to \"populate\" my life and my memories. If I'm totally frank, that was more important than my success at the MA even. I was fed up of being lonely, and I wanted to see the world.\n\nThe first semester was a disaster. A happy one, but it was nevertheless. Being poor, building my home, following my lessons, and  in general getting my shit together in a new city was difficult and tiring. But also joyful. The lively toil. I was now ready to make friends, start touring my country, finding a job (so that I didn't depend on student loans and family support). Conquer my dreams for the couple years ahead.\n\nCome March this covid bullshit hit the fan and it just crushed all that. I was back home and doing online lessons (which I ended up deferring). Dealt with bs and the \"new normal\" like y'all did, so nothing I can complain about that you also can't...\n\nI took to studying. Reading papers, learning useful side stuff. Had a lot of free time, having deferred my semester. But in the summer, _saudade_ started hitting me. It was the time all my dreams would've been realised. I'd be on trains backpacking (well not exactly, I'm kind of a fancy bitch) and visiting a lot of new cities. I'd be participating in group activities, going to conferences, workshops. Making friends, acquaintances, find a significant other. I'd been mostly studying shit for the last decade basically, and I'd the break that I needed. Keeping up with the MA wouldn't be a problem. I'm used to that shit. Have always been a successful failure, na meen.\n\nBut covid came and rendered that future impossible, and I had this feeling which in portuguese is called \"saudade\", it's a longing for a future that'll never happen. This paralysed me. I procrastinated like the lazy mouse, like the singing ladybug, like these lazy ass self of mine had _never_ done. I still have my novel from september last year lying on my table, half-read (and I'm a total bookworm), even tho it's a jolly great beautiful one I was planning to read years ago (took some time to find the edition I wanted). Whenever I sit down to study, this longing, this yearning just invades my head. If I stick around and push for say 30 min or so, I win and get shit done. Otherwise, I plunge into laughing at shit on lulzy subs or twitter, or watch silly infotainment on youtube (tried all kind of blocking, but that's not the issue; if I focus, I need no blocking, if I can't, no blocking helps).\n\nA detail is that this is not work I *have* to do, nobody really expects me to read papers throughout the summer or devour statistics and research methods books, or study alternative theories in my field. It was a goalpost *I* put out there for myself. I still have a semester before my thesis and have a couple nice research questions ready, so I'm nowhere a failure as far as the MA is concerned. Nor am I particularly sad for not being able to fix my social life or find a lovely queen to share my throne in the palace of procrastination. It's sad that I'll have to be responsible and wait, but it's not my fault and I'm not alone in this (call me twisted but being in this with the entire world has it's own unique sense of cosmopolitanist camaraderie), so I be patient.\n\nBut this _saudade_. And having spent the entire summer and a half doing nothing but catering to my lazy ass self copious amounts of instant online gratification. It makes me sad, and it makes me procrastinate. I know I'll be okay when the semester gets going...\n\nAnybody else in this situation? Can't but procrastinate? In this blue mood? If yes, I really wanna know how you deal(t) with it.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. It'd be a couple paragraphs but having opened the jar, I couldn't but spill the beans... Stay safe y'all!!...",

I say forced because I lost my funding because my department was unsatisfied with my mediocre teaching evaluations, students either rated me as the worst or the best. \n\nMy advisor said he will fund me this semester, but he hasn't sent anything yet and in truth I did not tell him of this fact because I felt ashamed of disappointing him and burdening him with my failures. He's supportive in talk, but he's absolutely clueless in helping me through this ordeal and how hurt I've been since I lost funding. You'd think it stings to lose funding, but to me it was a sign of no confidence in me from everyone, my advisor, the department, etc. It's been haunting me ever since.\n\nEvery time I try to write my dissertation, I burst in tears and drawn back to the memory of my meeting with my advisor when he gave the sad news. Right now, the dissertation's deadline is close and I'm nowhere near in finishing it. I don't recognize anything from my dissertation, I don't know what I'm writing or think, it's all alien to me now. \n\nI avoid eye contact with anyone, I feel very anxious coming to campus, I pretend to be okay when talking with others (which is almost never), I get easily distracted and procrastinate, I feel so lonely and want to tell how unfair I was treated, but am so afraid that others will see me thin-skinned and that I deserved it. \n\nI sought counselling, but am not satisfied in their help in dealing with it. Always concentrating on myself, focus on myself, let's move froward, it's all talk, but no action. I just can't do that, not when the department still see me as a defective student who hurt their bottom line. What I want is action, I want an apology, I want my funding restored, I want the whole university to know how the department treats their grad student so badly. \n\nI trained to be an academic since my undergrad years and to see this ideal shattered in a mere moment was just traumatic. \n\n",

        "post": "Currently in the second and final semester of a 1-year lock step finance master\u2019s program at my home state flagship. It\u2019s week 4 of the semester and I should be extra motivated to build on the 3.0 I got in the fall, especially since this semester is meant to be the more difficult of the two. And generally, I do really like my school and my classmates.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m honestly not entirely sure I like *being a graduate student*. I\u2019ve always been a huge people\u2019s person who enjoys socializing and getting to know people, but I\u2019ve really found it difficult to have any semblance of a social life or even relaxation time completely guilt-free. I had Covid all through the second half of winter break and only recovered just in time for the grind of classes to start again, which I found lowkey frustrating. Most of my in-class friends are commuters like myself, so it\u2019s been tough to really establish close friendships since we really only see each other in class. Even our group chats on iMessage/WhatsApp are basically solely class-related. My school is in the Big 10, but we can\u2019t really enjoy the perks of being at a Big 10 school with the days of weekend partying and frequent sports attendance of course behind us. It\u2019s mostly all work now. Even spring break won\u2019t be completely guilt free as we have an exam and a case study due the middle of the week we get back. And most of the professors are rather average save for a couple or three that are good. \n\nWorst part is that in hindsight I should\u2019ve *easily* gotten more than a 3.0 first semester. While I comfortably cleared the 2.5 program minimum, I know I\u2019m capable of more. The problem is that actually applying myself is seen as painful instead of solidifying the foundation of what\u2019s taught in class. Classes are Monday thru Thursday (my cohort actually has Tuesdays off this semester), but on my off days it feels like I\u2019d rather be doing anything but actually studying. I admittedly spent a lot more time with non-grad school friends last semester than I should\u2019ve, and even had a brief but toxic relationship that dominated my headspace. I took two years off post-undergrad to work before coming back to school, and my current school is also quite a step up in intensity from my lower-ranked OOS generic state school UG. But sadly my procrastination tendencies are still present. I\u2019m even writing this as I\u2019m taking a break from actually diving into a textbook lol. \n\nI\u2019ve started to go to the gym more often which will definitely help me. But I\u2019m kinda searching for words of affirmation and encouragement from fellow grad students to help me stay focused and locked in during this semester. To stop constantly looking ahead to spring break in five weeks\u2019 time, or early May when it\u2019s all over and instead take this shit day-by-day. \n\nI appreciate y\u2019all in advance!",

My notes were disorganized, I had long forgot key readings from the past, and I didn't even get to some of the readings on my list. I felt defeated, not by the test but by myself. My cavalier attitude over the last few months, punctuated by boredom, busyness, and lazyness got the best of me when it counted. Months of lackadaisical studying led me straight to disappointment and disillusionment. If I can't even study for this, how can I get through academia or through professional life? \n\nIt wasn't the only moment of dire frustration and anguish today. Earlier I looked at one of the questions and felt holplessly unable to answer it. I even looked up carpenter jobs, only to feel dejected yet again: I can't lift 75lbs over my head. I burned off frustration at the gym, but it quickly returned when I hit submit. \n\nAfter submitting the exam (and some sad, reflective music) I turned back to the document, realizing full well that any edits were null and void for my committee. But I didn't continue writing for them. I continued writing for myself, to prove that I could tackle that subject, albeit outside of the designated time. And what I wrote came out pretty good. I still hadn't addressed all my qualms with my responses, but it was a small victory, one over my anguish and downtrodden demeanor. But more importantly one over my procrastination and callous attitude that I'll sneak by with minimal prep and effort. I won't sneak by, not without hard work, determination and focus. I need to further cultivate these traits. But first I need a beer and some sleep.  ",

        "post": "I am looking for some advice. \n\nLast May I graduated with a B.A. in Biology from a pretty good school. My grades were pretty terrible coming out of it, though. It wasn't for lack of effort of learning, I just hated the academic hamster wheel of cram, purge, forget, repeat. I saw it as a waste of money and time if I went a school and got decent grades, but didn't learn a damn thing. So junior year, I made the decision to not care about my grades, and instead to focus on learning in depth. I saw that the best professors were the ones that put imminence to the information, and the worst ones didn't, so I worked to scaffold as much of my course's curriculums with background info, and follow those rabbit holes till I felt like I had a thorough understanding. Admittedly though, crippling procrastination and a later realized ADD made the empirical product of my learning crusade even less desirable than I had imagined...\n\nOver 60% of my college essays were turned in late. I nearly didn't graduate because of essays that I refused to turn in without being satisfied of their quality (one of which used 50 primary sources on a two page review article on global warming). Since graduating, I have made conscious efforts become a more discipline and long-term worker, sadly something that was a painfully missing part in the equation while I was in school. Everyone keeps telling me that grades don't really matter, and that my genuine passion is something that will show through, but it is hard to believe them because none of them are in my field. I love life sciences of all kinds, and I love obsessively researching. I think this could be a asset in grad school, once I am able do it in more of a structured and timely fashion. \n\nMy issue is that most grad schools I have seen require a GPA above 3.0 (mine was 2.5). My idea to get me into grad school is to bolster my GPA with lots of reputable work experiences. I just did a job with a Conservation corps, and though it was only tangentially related to my field, it did give me a lot of experience in the outdoors, and was the perfect thinking space after literally living the opening scene of Chris Farley's Tommy Boy. But that was seasonal, and I am again desperate for a job.\n\n**Tl;dr** I barely squeaked by with a biology degree because hated the cramming cycle and at the heavy cost of my GPA, I obsessively learned instead. Now I am looking for career advice...\n\n\n*What are your guys' thoughts on unpaid Field Assistance jobs?\n\n\n*Do you think I even still have a chance at getting into a reputable grad school?\n\n\n*Any other advice is greatly appreciated\n\n(edit: format)",

I had a light course load this year to finish off lingering requirements and was supposed to be spending most of my time working on research. *Supposed to be*, but I use my time so inefficiently and procrastinate so much that I've barely made any progress since last year.  \n\nI've been spending far more time than I should doing unproductive make-work for my research, department and university service, attending seminars and networking events, goofing off on the internet, playing games, working out, drinking, my relationship and social life. \n\nFor some reason, I only have this motivation problem when doing research; I was always able to summon the will to do homework and study for my courses. When I do work on research, it's barely even on *my* research, but instead mostly reading the literature. I like reading papers, going to journal club, combing Google Scholar. I can spend endless amounts of time finding more interesting things to read that give me ideas. Yet somehow I am completely unmotivated to do all the work that goes into pushing my ideas to the publication stage. I open programs, encounter some minor obstacle, get distracted, and avoid returning to what I was doing for as long as possible.\n\nMy advisor has been nice about this but is getting impatient, he wants me to submit a manuscript and a thesis proposal this summer. I'm good at putting up new hurdles to deal with in my work, so I maintain the illusion of progress, when the reality is from week to week, not much gets accomplished. People always talk about academic impostor syndrome, but I think I am actually impostoring! I know my stuff from dicking around reading so much and I've been exploiting that to distract my advisor from my lack of progress. \n\nI don't want to keep up this charade. Does anyone have any advice for snapping out of a research procrastination funk and getting shit done? Right now I feel completely paralyzed to change how I use my time. This brings me considerable anxiety and I worry about it all the time but don't know how to move past this.",

I also sometimes multitask in meetings and seminars (especially if there\u2019s a PowerPoint presentation involved), forget about paperwork until after it is due, and sometimes if I\u2019m talking to someone and I mention a paper I read a while ago I\u2019m vague or I misremember details and get them wrong.\n>\n> I also procrastinate, don\u2019t know how to network, don\u2019t keep my LinkedIn updated, am not part of academic Twitter, am slow about checking and answering my email, and am afraid of admitting that I don\u2019t know something and asking for help because I think everyone else must already know it and I\u2019m ashamed to admit that I don\u2019t.\n\nOK, I've shown you mine... your turn!

I had an app called \"Rescue Time\" that tracked my activity online, and I realized I was spending up to 2 hours each day on fucking Facebook. I still do Instagram and obviously Reddit, but nothing is as addictive to me as FB, probably because (1) it's so visual, and I am a very visual person, (2) it's people I know irl, so there is a \"gossip\" aspect, (3) it's full of shit to click on and articles to follow, etc. \n\nThe benefits I miss from FB are: finding out about events (both private party invites and local sales, shows, workshops, etc.); seeing what long-distance friends and family are up to and having easy contact with them; some \"Groups\" I was in for different hobbies and interests. Clearly, there are other ways to access all these things, but FB is the most convenient.\n\nBasically, I would like to re-activate my FB after the elections, but I absolutely cannot afford to be losing 2 hours a day/up to 15 hours a week on that shit. If I can't limit my usage, then I will have to delete my account. \n\nHow have others addressed this challenge? \n\n",

I quickly realized that I wouldn't be able finish it in time and ended up getting a zero in it.\n\nI still got an A in that course though, so I thought that my problem was not so bad.\n\nThen in my final year we had a two semester (or year) long final project. After doing absolutely nothing (no implementation, no progress, just meetings with advisor and discussing implementation ideas and stalling with \"potential\" problems we \"might\" have) till about the end of the year, my advisor threatened to fail me and potentially delay my graduation by a year. At that point there were only two weeks left. I spent those two weeks to end up with a presentable project and working code by the deadline. The fact that I was working in a very unique area helped and I ended up getting an A grade (given by a joint committee).\n\nAt this point I KNEW that I had a problem but still thought that I could deal with it because I never had to face any consequences.\n\n\nNow I am in grad school. I spend my days watching netflix or reading quora or spending hours on facebook, just scrolling and scrolling. Or I will clean the apartment, if that is clean I will work on my car trying to fix stuff that does not need fixing.\n\nI have weekly meetings with my advisor but I start working a day before the meeting, working through the night and have just enough material by the morning to have some discussion.\n\nIt has come to the point that I start to get anxiety near the time of the meetings and often have to postpone the meeting by giving some lame excuse.\n\nI like my area and my advisor and I want to do research and a PhD, so motivation is not the issue, I think.... \n\nI tried to correct my behavior but was not successful. I turned off my phone and put my laptop to a side. Printed hard copies of the papers I had to read and made sure there were no distractions.\n\nAt the end of the day I had read only half a page and I had read it like 20 times, again and again. But when there is a deadline coming I can read a full paper in around 2-3 hours. I can happily spend hours and hours doing nothing and just staring into space sitting in my chair.\n\nI dont know what I should do. I have tried getting rid of distractions, changing my work place (home, lab, library etc). I dont know what more I could do. At this point it is severely affecting the pace of my degree.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. ",

So I figure, why not next week? Then in the next week, what about the week after?\n\nI've looked up ADHD diagnosis and I'm fairly certain I have it, albeit potentially mildly. If I go to the doctor for a diagnosis, would they just think I'm trying to get drugs so I can focus for my thesis? Is it even worth trying to get an ADHD diagnosis, or do you think this is just classic procrastination?\n\nAny thoughts, ideas, or advice are welcome.

I've made a lot of progress this summer, but the things that always trip me up are 1) starting work late because I don't feel well in the morning (seeing a doctor about it), and 2) getting back to work after breaks. I think the problem is I don't have anyone to work with. No one cares when I show up or leave or has more than a slight interest in my progress. I would love to be able to text someone when I find myself anxiously scrolling facebook at the end of a break, looking for the next distraction, and say \"I need to go back to work now,\" and have them text me back \"Go back to work now!\" It would really do the trick. However, this would be an annoying job for my spouse or friends. I don't want to go asking other students in my program, because I'd rather not blab about my troubles to everyone in order to find the person I most closely share then with. (I'm a regular redditor but made a throwaway account for this for the same reason.)\n\nI'd love to team up with someone who has similar issues. I don't care about your age or gender or field. I imagine that someone doing grad school or freelance work would have the most similar needs, especially someone with a long-term project. Someone in a nearby time zone (Pacific or Central US) with fairly standard work hours would be nice. I would like to be able to exchange small victories and troubles and cheer each others' progress. I don't imagine a super chatty relationship, rather something like friendly officemates who mostly just want to focus on their work.

        "post": "During my time in a Master's program and also the work force, I took on a personal scheduling system that fits my tasks into a set amount of time instead of budgeting time for my tasks. For example, I only wanted to work 9-5 at my job - literally, start working at 9am and stop at 5pm. I prioritized my tasks, delegated projects, declined projects, and made sure everything I needed to do was done in a 40-hour time slot over 5 days. Tim Ferriss pushes an extreme example of this in \"4 Hour Work Week.\" [This article](http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/16/opinion/stone-leave-work-day/index.html) takes a more \"working mom\" approach but talks about Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, doing the same thing.\n\nThis carried over well into my Master's studies. Granted, I had a project-based \"thesis\" versus an actual paper thesis but the weekly schedule structure was the same: aside from classes, I only wanted to spend X hours per week on school work - what could I cull, what meetings could be shortened or eliminated, etc. \n\nThe number of work hours went up from working in the field to doing a Master's so the actual \"40 hours\" stated in my title is arbitrary, but my question is if it's possible to continue this type of scheduling into a PhD program (I start in about a month). I've sat in on PhD classes, talked with the current students at my program, and also asked professors from various programs and from what they've said and what I gather, work in a PhD program is never really done. You could spend every day of the week working on a paper and there would still be more to do, even when you successfully defend and get your diploma, there's still more to do, so knowing that, wouldn't you want to stop PhD-related work at some point (during the week) and move on to other things like personal work (family life, kids, etc)? Where is that line between putting your heart and passion into your program and overworking yourself to an early burnout? \n\nI've asked this question to a few other people and the response I immediately get is \"You must be lazy.\" If you had this response in your head as you read my question, I don't blame you. I fully understand how this could come across as me only wanting to put in the bare minimum and scrape by with my PhD program. When I was in undergrad, I was a huge procrastinator with no time management skills and I would often BS my way through \"bare minimum\" work at the last minute. Ironically, this new type of scheduling has eliminated my procrastination. \n\nMy preference is to continue this but if the consensus is that a PhD program is really about working day and night, I'll have to find another way to schedule myself.

        "post": "I\u2019ve been feeling like I\u2019ve had been falling prey to procrastination so much more than I would like until I came across this extremely practical concept called the 2 Minute Rule. No matter what\u2019s going on in your day, if there is a habit that you are trying to stick to, you need to have a 2 minute version of it that you can rely on.\n\nThe 2 Minute Rule was first mentioned in David Allen\u2019s legendary book Getting Things Done and then popularized by James Clear, who wrote Atomic Habits. It\u2019s perhaps the most realistic hack to managing habits that I\u2019ve come across.\n\nFor every positive activity that you are doing, try to have a 2 minute version of it.\n\n* Exercising: My 2 Minute Version would be 20 pushups and 20 setups\n* Writing: My 2 Minute Version would be opening up my laptop and writing one new sentence\n* Reading: My 2 Minute Version would be reading just one more page before bed\n\nI highly recommend you try this out. I explain this further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2dQyTlyYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2dQyTlyYk)\n\nOnce you start incorporating small versions of your habits into your life, I can assure you that procrastination will gradually start to slip away.",

Every day I sit at home and say I am going to finish, but instead I read reddit or watch Netflix because even thinking about attaching it to an email and hitting \"send\" makes me paralyzed with fear. And the longer I sit on it, the more I'm filled with a sense of shame and failure. My procrastination is exacerbated by the fact that I don't really have a hard deadline to force me to finish since I am not technically filing until the fall, but I'm moving in a month or so and should really have everything finalized before I go. I've made multiple promises to send it out in vague \"end of the week\" timeframes that I have not carried through on. At this point I have a pretty short and concrete list of things I need to do (write three more paragraphs of intro on specific topic, add four citations, format a couple of figures etc.) but I look at this document and just think it's a pile of crap, it's obvious these projects aren't done and why should I even finish it if it will be rejected? Obviously, I should finish it and send it out as soon as possible so I have time to get comments and revise but, I don't know, I guess I feel like the longer I wait the longer I have before someone tells me I suck and I've wasted the last two years and don't deserve a degree at all. My friend wrote her MS thesis with what seemed like even less research and it was accepted so realistically mine should be fine.\n\nI don't really know why I'm posting here other than to get this off my chest.  I know what I need to do I just... can't. I don't even know how to talk about it, people ask me how it's going and I just feel like an idiot admitting I haven't been doing anything, just sitting at home like a pathetic lump. I don't know if I need a therapist or someone to punch me in the face. Maybe both, I feel like that much of a wreck.\n\nEdit: Thanks to anyone who read this and especially to those who have responded. I've already tried a lot of the strategies mentioned but it's still helpful to hear them and more. Between that and just getting this off my chest I managed to make a big push on my figures and am going to send out the mostly-finished half out tonight even if it means asking my fiance to write the email. Hopefully this gives me enough momentum for me to get the other part up to snuff before I get comments back.",

        "post": "I am just starting my second semester of graduate school and am finding it impossible to be interested in my research.  I am in the environmental science program, in a direct PhD program (so i'm going straight from undergrad to PhD, but still doing a thesis) which is an interdisciplinary program, so I work primarily through the sociology department.\n\nI've always been a straight A student, and got straight As (if you include an A- in stats) my first semester (though with a lot of late nights and procrastination).  But my advisor has given me various recommendations of literature I could read to prepare for my research project, but I just have been falling completely behind on them.  I have hardly done any (he hasn't given me TOO much, but perhaps it's because there isn't any rigid structure/deadlines to complete the readings).\n\nI have felt a constant fear about anything graduate school related since the application process, which for me was wrought with anxiety and worry.  I remember giving my first draft of my personal statement to a faculty member to review and having it harshly criticized, which freaked me out.  And I had sort of a panic attack where I went outside walking several miles at night in the winter, and when I came back I was even more worried that I wouldn't make it into graduate school (I had missed the deadline of one school, submitted the others last minute).\n\nI had some temporary relief when I found out I was accepted into the environmental science program and the enviro soc program at 2 different schools, though I feel convinced it was because of my advisor's recommendation letter and my grades/GRE score (which I don't think really adequately represent how well one will do in grad school)\n\nAfter being accepted into those programs, I sort of vegged out the rest of my senior year of college - lots of netflix binging, staying inside, lying around.  I had a pretty good summer, but again any email about stuff I had to do to prepare for graduate school frightened me.\n\nI know a lot of it is in my head, but I have had this constant feeling of being in a crisis.  It's like when something bad happens in life and you get these waves of panic followed by waves of calmness, but stretched over the course of my first semester.\n\nWhenever I get an email from my advisor, I feel panic.  It might be because I haven't led a very dramatic life, but honestly the closest fear I can relate to my fear of graduate school is a fear of death I had as a kid, when I would have these realizations that death was inevitable and I would think about what eternity meant.  I mean it's similar in the sense that I jolt up from bed with the realization that I am in graduate school and have to walk around to get rid of the feeling.\n\nI'm planning on seeking out some of the free counseling services the school provides, as I've never been this afraid and unsure of life.  Maybe it's all in my head and I will get used to grad school.  But in my heart I feel like I was meant to do something else, and I kind of want to pursue a career as a park ranger or something similar (I enjoy learning various plants and animals in my free time).  I'm definitely doubting that I want to get a PhD, and considering just getting the masters and figuring things out after that. I just feel like the academic world is not for me.  I'd love to hear other people's thoughts and experiences and advice.\n\nThanks for listening, sorry for the long post.\n\ntl;dr I'm a good student in terms of grades but graduate school/research terrifies, and I panic about anything grad school-related.  Probably have some mental issues but also thinking graduate school, especially a direct PhD program, is not for me.\n",

        "post": "Hi! Im an undergrad studying biology in my first going to second year and I was hoping to get some advice from adults in the similar field further along the same path.  \nI was wondering how important is GPA from undergrad? Its been my first year in college it's starting to worry me because of my GPA. I've already recieved 3 C's and several B's in my lower division weeder classes, and the only thing keeping my above a 3.0 are my general education and math classes. I'm starting to worry if it's going to affect my future, and if I need a wake up call to perform better.   \nIn high school I did fairly well without studying, and as a result never developed proper time management skills (ie adhd). Being cognizant of this I have been actively searching for solutions, but it's still a work in progress and I still procrastinate studying and more often than I find acceptable forget homework.  \nI understand that GPA is crucial for becoming a doctor due to med school admissions. I've also read that it's important for grad admissions, although less so. In the case of going into academia, I've read that undergrad GPA is very important for a career in academia as where you do your PhD (ie prestigous-ness) opens doors and sort of dictates where you go. \n\n  \nI believe (for now) that I want to go into industry after getting into my PhD, but I do want to get into a top grad school (not necessarily Ivy, but top for my field) for the best research experience and connections possible.   \nThe only thing going for me is that I should have plenty of research experience before I graduate(Im currently in 2 labs that I plan to stay in). My low GPA will probably also hinder chances for summer opportunities like internships. Pragmatically speaking, it also doesn't help for admissions that I'm an Asian male.   \nI would consider myself to be highly ambitious, and I wish I was more exceptional. I want to be able to work in top biotech and tech companies related to the science field after my education, but that doesn't seem to be the directions I'm currently heading.\n\n  \nI don't mind anyone to respond with brutal honesty, and feel free not to sugarcoat, I just want to know realistically what/how dire my situation right now.

The end result is that I end up doing the bare minimum and hoping that I'd pass. It worked in the first semester, but now, as I'm done with my semester-end exams, I'm certain I'm gonna fail two out of five classes this time.\n\nI can't get what went wrong with me. I can't seem to get in the mindset I had in college to get things done and I'm not exerting myself as much as I did during my time as an undergrad.  It's a miracle that I made this far with the level of effort that I actually put in. Whenever I study or do assignments, I begin to procrastinate very quickly, and I don't do practice exercises much if they seem hard.\n\nI can't figure out whether It's something in me that's holding back or whether I'm too stupid for grad school. I'd really wish I could see a therapist or a psychiatrist but an appointment costs a fortune, and I can't afford it at this time.\n\nOn top of this, I'm feeling I'm getting too old for CS Grad School as well.\n\nCan anyone relate to this? How do I alleviate this line of thinking?",

I know that as a grad student I shouldn't be this way about them. I knew that papers would be a huge part of this experience. For my first semester and a half, I started getting better at the process but then Covid hit and made it worse. They moved my program to all online and I despise that. I only want to study or do homework in the library or a place like that.   When I'm in my own room, I often do not even pull out my laptop.  It's weird. Does anyone have advice forn me?",

I work in a great lab on a very cool project -- I'd go as far as to say that this is my dream project and my dream lab.\n\nMy problems started before I came here -- I've been dealing with feelings of disassociation throughout my adult life. Still, I know with almost full certainty that this is what I want to do. The disassociation comes in the form of exhaustion when I need to sit down and read a paper, learn stats or engage with my work in any kind of way. It also comes in the form of social dissociation and distancing from my advisor and labmates, spurred on by chronic imposter syndrome.\n\nI'd say that I have struggled with acute perfectionism all my life. It got so bad that 2 years into art college, I hit a wall and couldn't continue (simply couldn't produce art anymore). After dreaming of becoming an artist for 10 years, applying to and attending competitive middle and high school programs for the arts, winning accolades and recognition, I just burnt out completely. I don't know if anyone else has had a similar experience but in my case, I didn't fall out of love with art at all. I had a period where I was committed, motivated, productive -- all of the signs of success -- and then one day, I questioned what I do it all for, and I couldn't find an answer. I felt lost and empty. Maybe I missed something important that was happening beneath the surface, but I went from being a straight-A student to being severely depressed and on academic probation in less than a month's time. I don't think I ever fully recovered.\n\nBut I will say though that when I started to work on art professionally is when I started to experience intense problems. I found that I lost track of my own voice fairly quickly on the path to try to meet expectations, I had problems with my self-confidence, fell into intense perfectionistic and procrastination tendencies, and generally was very miserable and avoided contact with people.\n\nWhen I dropped out, I realized that I had a chance to start anew, and committed myself instead to working to become a plant scientist (my other love) and pursued that instead. I worked *hard* to get opportunities, but in order to do so sometimes would lie about my work a little because I was still struggling with disassociation from my core motivations, not knowing what they were anymore.\n\nThe experience continued to haunt me as opportunities came my way. I think I never did mend my confidence, so now I am in a program that I feel I don't deserve to be in. I know I can succeed if only I can figure this out and somehow make up for all the lost time this year when I just couldn't engage. If only I could also keep avoiding my advisor for a little longer. He wants to talk with me tomorrow, and I don't think I can bring anything to the table for this chat because of this problem, basically. Can anyone relate, or offer some words of advice?",

        "title": "[Long] Thinking about life after graduation: a rambling attempt at self-introspection",
        "post": "This whole thing is an over-written, over-detailed, bloated stream of consciousness I wrote to try and crystallize my thoughts. I feel like I should apologize for posting it - it might help others to read this, might give them insight into their own thoughts, but really I'm posting it because I'm looking for answers and don't trust myself to find the right ones. If you're still interested, but not interested enough to read the whole thing (don't blame you), here's a tl;dr -\n\n* Expecting to defend in August after 6 years in doctoral program\n* Have great adviser, support network, constantly told I'm on track and doing well; nonetheless struggling (guilt, imposter syndrome, apathy, no motivation, chronic procrastination, the usual)\n* Have come to despise most of my research/academic/professional responsibilities (even those I still enjoy); thinking/working on them fills me with anxiety; feel trapped in my program; don't care if I graduate, just want *out*\n* Have never wanted a \"real job\", just want to learn and write and not be beholden to arbitrary authority, and so have put almost no thought into what comes after graduation (\"If I keep my head down and focus on getting through one day at a time, it will all work out\")\n* Really enjoy data analysis but rarely get to do it; recently was able to teach some data analysis and had the first \"guilt-free\" fun I've had in months\n* Got me feeling hopeful about *after* I graduate; maybe there is something to look forward to, and my best chance to finish this degree is to find it\n* Listed out a bunch of things I enjoy and detest in work; basically brainstorming\n* Maybe this helped? Dunno. Definitely didn't hurt.\n\n\n**The story so far...**\nI worked in fast food and retail throughout high school and college and loathed every minute of it; the lack of control, limited or no opportunities for learning, propping up the bittersweet \"boring dystopia\" of modern consumerism, and so on (sidenote: it's strange that I now look back on those times fondly; am I looking through rose-colored glasses or was I just that naive?). Regardless, it sparked a phobia of being a (for lack of a better term) \"cog in the machine\", the stereotypical dead-eyed 9-to-5 suburbia-living hour-long-commuting rat-race-running office worker.\n\nWhen I went to get my MS, I did so because I enjoyed being a college student and didn't want to get a \"real job\". Although I had no research experience, I've always had an affinity for quantification and logical systems, and a passionate appreciation for natural complexity, and those were good enough reasons for me.\n\nAfter some limbo, I found an adviser who saw potential and pushed me to enroll in the PhD program and work in his lab - again, not having any real plans for my future, I did so simply because I would be stipended for the next 4-5 years and hey, I've always loved science, so how bad could it be?\n\nTurns out, pretty bad. It's strange to write that knowing I have a wonderful adviser and a robust support network, but I cannot deny the second half of my grad school career has been...less than ideal: depression, alcohol and drug abuse, social isolation, constant anxiety, self-depreciation, abandonment of self-improvement, disillusionment, etc. etc.\n\nA side effect of this has been a complete loss of fucks to give about anything grad school related. Work and research I once willingly stayed overnight in my lab to finish now turns my stomach like spoiled milk. I used to volunteer for department events and leadership at every opportunity; now I haven't been to a department meeting in over two years. Coursework is interesting in the moment, but as soon as it requires something outside of the classroom I feel nothing but anxiety. Even being assigned simple tasks by my adviser fills me with inexplicable dread.\n\nLikewise, thinking about what comes *after* graduation fills me with anxiety. It's like I'm back at square one, fresh out of college and not wanting to get a \"real job\", except now I can't just kick the can down the road by applying to grad school. I should feel exhilarated, right? Almost out of shitty grad school, almost back in control of my life, almost done living paycheck-to-paycheck, almost at the point where I can finally leverage all the experience and skills and knowledge I've gained to carve out new life for myself.\n\nI don't feel exhilarated. I feel like I'm on death row. All I want is to be out of grad school, but once I'm out I feel like I'll be even more aimless, with nothing but bad options in front of me. I don't want to be in academia, or industry, or research. Not at a PhD level anyway - not as a PI, not designing and running studies, kissing ass and writing grants and putting up with all the toxic elements of the field. Fuck that. (disclaimer: I'm not trying to talk shit about PIs; PIs are essential and being a PI is a hell of a lot of work, just more than I think I'm willing to commit to).\n\n**Light in the darkness**\nI had an interesting interaction last week. My PI (who runs multiple programs) passed a MS student on to me. She was writing her thesis but had never done any kind of analysis. To paraphrase my PI: \"She just needs a ttest and a logistic regression: walk her through it real quick so she can put the results in her thesis.\"  My PI probably imagined this would take 15 minutes - she'd send me the data, I'd crunch the numbers, done - but it turned into a two-hour in-depth crash course in data. I walked her through every step: extracting the data, processing it into the correct format, framing the hypotheses, selecting the appropriate test, actually running the test, interpreting the output, and summarizing the results. \n\nSee, I'm a data wonk. *By far* the most interesting thing I've done in grad school (besides teaching) is data analysis. I can extract, concatenate, array, process, analyze, model, interpret, and report data all day. I've spent dozens of hours combing through documentation, tech support pages, pirated educational materials, and esoteric mathematical publications just to figure out which parameter I should select in my model. The only times I have willingly worked from home over the past three years have been to do data analysis. It just scratches some deep itch in my soul, allows me to bring to bear all of the skills I enjoy *and* excel at, and each discovery, insight, and milestone brings a deep satisfaction. Plus, I think I'm pretty good at it (hard to tell though; my lab has relatively little analytical experience so I'm mostly self-taught). One of the reasons I've been so dejected recently has been because my PI has moved me away from analysis; I haven't been able to geek out over data in over half a year.\n\nSo when it came time to teach the student...I couldn't help myself. This was nectar of the gods, manna from on high. For the two hours I worked through this with her, I genuinely *enjoyed* my job as a grad student. No anxiety, no self-doubt, no procrastination, no guilt, no \"woe is me\". Just pure, undistilled self-satisfaction. And it went great: the student was very receptive and kept thanking me for walking her through everything step-by-step. Plus, I was productive! I did what my PI asked and upheld my professional responsibilities, so I had fun *and* didn't feel guilty about it! The last time I had fun without feeling guilt was months ago, sometime last summer when I was still doing analysis.\n\nIn retrospect, that tutoring session was bittersweet. On the one hand, it was that ecstatic mix of productivity and fun that made me feel like I was actually \"doing what you love\". On the other, everything else now seems all the more dull and uninteresting. I barely did any work for the rest of the day; as usual, just thinking about my other work filled me with anxiety, and forcing myself to do it felt like pulling teeth.\n\nI don't expect any other opportunities like that anytime soon; it was a fluke. But I can't stop thinking about it, how good it felt to enjoy being productive. I can't tell if I'm feeling it for the first time or if I've forgotten what it felt like.\n\n**Now what?**\nMy defense is likely going to be in August. I have no plans for after, so assuming I pass I'll probably just stay with my lab and get a small pay raise. I doubt this will fix anything: I'll still be in academia, still be doing the same work, still be in the same environment. Maybe graduation will be a paradigm shift that will lift the veil and allow me to go back to enjoying research, but I doubt it. There's too much bitterness, too much apathy.\n\nStill, I don't want to be miserable for the rest of my life. Grad school sucks, but one way or another I'm almost done with it. Grad school may have forced me into apathy and destroyed my drive to excel, but I feel that my interests and passions will return once I no longer have that ax hanging over my head. It doesn't *feel* possible, but I *know* it's possible. And I've got to so something, eventually.\n\nI often think about \"Ghostcrawler\", a game developer who used to be a community representative for Blizzard. He got that job after earning a PhD in Marine Biology, and despite sinking so many years into grad school, he was able to launch a career in an entirely different industry. It's comforting to know that I'm not locked into academia, that I still have options, even if I may not know which ones yet.\n\nSo, I've been thinking on stuff like that analysis tutoring and other times I've been productive and enjoyed it. I don't know how, but there must be some way for me to steer my career into happier waters, to \"do what I love\". I'm just going to list out things in three categories: What I love, what I'm OK with, and what I detest. I'll also list out some of my long-standing \"dream careers\". Nothing is in any particular order...\n\n**What I love**\n\n* I love being happy and not being chronically stressed.\n* I love having free time to dedicate to self-improvement, relaxation, and hobbies\n* I love teaching, at any level, in any capacity, from kindergarten to college, from tutoring to building a curriculum\n* I love data analysis and coding, of almost any kind\n* I love writing - both creatively to build and explore novel experiences, and scientifically to efficiently convey information\n* I love exploring, understanding, and guiding others through complex systems\n* I love detailed, careful, optimized work that is oriented to producing the best results without regard for arbitrary limits like funding and deadlines (yes, I know how naive that sounds)\n* I love creating experiences that give people new insights, perspectives, etc. Watching someone realize something for the first time - whether it's understanding the differences between an ANOVA and a Chi-Square Test, or appreciating the internal consistency of a well-designed fantasy magic system\n* I love experiencing new things, the rarer the better; e.g. observing a surgery, seeing the inside of a satellite factory, visiting McMurdo Station, riding on the vomit comet, seeing behind-the-scenes for movie/game production, etc. Any of those would not only make my day, but my year and possibly my whole life.\n\n**What I am OK with**\n\n* I am OK with not being the most productive, not working the most hours, not winning the \"rat race\", not earning employee of the month\n* I am OK with not making a lot of money / making just enough to save a few bucks each month.\n* I am OK with low job security\n* I am OK with not being publicly recognized for my work / working behind the scenes\n* I am OK with supervision and reporting to an authority, as long as I have the opportunity to push back and debate their decisions (within reason, of course)\n* I am OK with doing some boring and repetitive task (a lot of analysis is boring and repetitive, after all) as long as I know it's necessary and part of a larger process\n\n**What I detest**\n\n* I detest arbitrary authority/hierarchy/requirements: red tape, bureaucracy, paperwork, dress codes, rigid schedules, etc.\n* I detest blurred work-life boundaries; i.e. feeling like I have to think about work when not at work, or having to put in more than 40 hours a week to stay on par\n* I detest the \"quantity > quality\" mindset\n* I detest micromanagement; supervisors should only make sure I'm on the same page as them, and then let me figure out the rest\n* I detest stagnancy and sameness; work must be dynamic in some way, e.g. through new projects, new locations, new methods, etc.\n* I detest not being able to say \"no\"; I mean this in the context it's used in academia, i.e. you can say \"no\" but it will actively hurt your reputation, so no one ends up saying \"no\"\n* I detest a lack of reasonable options / feeling trapped\n* I detest managing others (note: this is because I tend to be either completely distant and focused on my own work or far too close and micromanaging everything they do; this might just be inexperience on my part)\n\n**My dream jobs**\n\n* Creative writer for a major entertainment enterprise (movies, video/tabletop games, etc.) or independent writer; before grad school burnt me out, I wrote hundreds of thousands of words building worlds, stories, and characters just for fun\n* Independent content producer, along the lines of \"infotainment\" (e.g. video essays)\n* Science communicator, promoting/providing scientific knowledge to non-scientists\n* Science advocate, along the lines of Carl Sagan and Bill Nye (i.e. lobbying for science-based policy)\n* Video game streamer (get paid to play video games? obviously a dream job!)\n* Freelance data analyst / scientific writer\n* Video game developer / software engineer / data analyst\n* Expert scientific consultant for movies / games\n* K12 / Undergrad / Graduate teacher (however, I'm worried this would be burn me out of teaching the same way grad school burnt me out of research)\n* College professor (I know, I know, I've been railing against academia this whole time; still, who wouldn't want to be a tenured professor who can enjoy many of the positives of academia - the teaching, mentoring, research, outreach, access - without the constant fear of losing your job and the constant pressure to produceproduceproduce?)\n* Hyper-specialized technical expert; i.e. the job is to \"take this code/system/program, learn it inside and out, and make it as optimized as possible\"\n* Pretty much anything involving spaceflight, deep-sea exploration, remote locations (e.g. Antarctica), and other endeavors on the fringes of our physical world that few people have access to.\n\n\n**Conclusions and Reflection**\nI've spent three hours writing this and that's probably far too much time (esp. when I think about all the research work I could've done... *fuck*). I'm sure there's more I can add to those lists but that's all I can think of at the moment. I feel better (i.e. less anxious/stressed) now, but I usually do after immersing myself in something that's not work. Moreover, I think writing out all of my loves/OKs/detests/dreamjobs helped me to better understand what I want out of a professional life (so not a complete waste of time), and that in turn made it easier for me to accept that, yes, I will have to make a living instead of retiring at 30 because we live in a capitalistic society and I'm not rich and I have useful skills that improve our society and the lives of those in it and the only way I'll die without regrets is if I make a sincere effort to leave the world a better place than I found it. It's not fair but then again the only fair thing in the universe is the conservation of energy. Plus, productivity is rewarding, and I think a lot of my anxiety is attributable to having lost that sense of reward somewhere along the way through grad school. All my life I've been able to knuckle down and produce when I need to, because I was rewarded when I did - schoolwork earned me grades, improving creative writing earned me self-confidence, college earned me acceptance into grad school, my research earned me praise from my advisers - but now it feels like I'm pouring my productivity into a black hole and getting nothing in return. Maybe it's mental illness, maybe it's laziness, maybe it's my inability to effectively delay gratification, maybe that's just how grad school affects people. Maybe it's Maybelline.\n\nRegardless, through writing this I've forced myself to think about it. Again, I feel like I should apologize for posting this - such a self-centered monologue feels like it belongs in a diary rather than a subreddit - but then again it's not violating any rules and now I'm just making excuses so I'mma just hit submit now.

        "post": "Hi, I'm a first year PhD student at pretty good university halfway across the planet from where I grew up. I joined here straight out of my undergrad, with very little research experience (I honestly have no idea why I got in, I still believe my advisor made a mistake while picking me). Now culture shock, personal issues and social anxiety aside, I was expecting to be pretty good at the work I did. Yet, every week, I find myself panicking the day before my meeting with my advisor, or the morning of my meeting with him, because I fear I am not working enough. I've seen plenty of posts around here of people working 12-14 hours a day, 7 days a week. Honestly, I envy you guys. The longest period that I have been able to stay productive for since the start of my PhD, has been 7 hours, and it has happened only a few times in the last 9 months.\n\nI sit in front of my PC (thanks for kicking me out of the labs, COVID. As if things weren't bad enough already.) everyday with plans to work, but I keep getting distracted and procrastinate till I can't no more. On average I end up being properly productive only around 10 hours every week. I don't know how to read papers. Now I can't tell if all of this is me being stupid and lazy, or because of mental health issues, or because I'm missing out on some basic methods, or because grad school is not for me. It stresses me out every week, and I want to know if this is common among early grad students, because I feel like if it keeps going like this, I'll have a nervous breakdown at some point, and I really really really don't want that happening again.\n\nP.S. I should add that my interest in science is driven by my curiousity. When I see something I don't understand, I have a drive to want to understand it. Unfortunately, from what I've experienced so far in my graduate life, it seems to be more about understanding some narrow field that no one really cares about to an extreme extent. I like being the jack of a few trades, but I feel like grad school is driving me to be a master of 1.24E-8  \n\n\nUPDATE: You all are awesome! You guys gave me the boost I needed to prepare my report for my meeting today (which got postponed to tomorrow because he confused me with another PhD student who had rescheduled their meeting). You guys gave me a lot to think about. I was half-considering quitting grad school today morning, now I'm much more hopeful. So thank you! I would like to repay you all with this [cuddle-puddle](https://imgur.com/a/CjbxHlM) that got me through my undergrad.",

        "title": "I'm a year and a half into my PhD, and I think I need to seek out testing for ADHD",
        "post": "Hi all, as a note before I begin, I'm going to talk to my therapist about this during our session on Wednesday, but until then I just wanted to get some stuff out and ask for advice from anyone who has had a similar experience. Also, I'm a student in microbiology with a BSc in biochemistry, so I know just about as much as the average person about psychology.\n\nSo as a background, I have been diagnosed with anxiety & depression since I was about 14, and I'm 23 now. I take SSRIs and they keep me mostly stable but that's it. From \\~ 8th grade until now I have had trouble with procrastination and paying attention in class, and I thought this was because I was either understimulated and bored, too depressed, or too anxious to engage. I made up for it by just re-teaching myself everything and cramming the night before. I still do this and I hate it, but a lot of people function like this so I figured any exacerbation was due to my mental health problems. I get good grades too, so there's no academic consequence for this behavior.\n\nI also have struggled with perfectionism and absolutely loathed any real or perceived rejection from anyone, making me ignore my needs and boundaries in favor of people-pleasing tendencies which of course causes me a lot of stress. Again though, there are a lot of introverted and socially anxious people in science that go through similar things.\n\nFinally, I have a few glaring symptoms that point me in the way of potentially being neurodivergent. First is that I have horrible sensory issues and have had them since I was a baby. Like yes, I have a \"sock system.\" Second is that I have been seen as \"weird\" my entire life, and have a hard time fitting in, but as I get older it seems people find that mostly endearing (or entertaining) about me. Oh and I always draw in class, meetings, or seminars, and if I don't I usually spend more of my energy looking like I'm paying attention rather than actually paying attention. More and more lately I cannot stand to sit for an hour-long seminar about anything.\n\nOkay, so about a year ago my mom came to me telling me that she had been learning a lot about ADHD lately and she was nearly positive I had it, for those reasons, among other symptoms including being really talkative, easily distracted, forgetful, etc. I spent a week or so seriously mulling it over and talking to friends and family about it, and most of them agreed I may have it. I went to my therapist to tell him I think I might have ADHD, and he told me that isn't really his specialty, he had not noticed me talk about symptoms related to ADHD, etc. He thought that my mom was trying to tell me there was something wrong with me that I needed to fix or something. This response honestly really freaked me out and I was so embarrassed that I just dropped it.\n\nSince then I have been really struggling with planning experiments, reading literature, and getting classwork done... *just* short of having any sort of consequences for it. Again, I'm writing my prelim, everyone in my cohort is stressed, and it's grad school. Which is always stressful. I just feel like I am doing much less than others while still having an incredibly hard time.\n\nThis has come to a head now that I realized that... my semester does not end this week. It ends next week, and I have an in-person final next week. And I planned to go visit my grandparents out of state next week. Have had a plane ticket for months and everything. Whether I can figure out what to do or not, this feels like such an embarrassing mistake on my part, compounded by so many other small mistakes in attention, time management, planning, etc. I have made over the semester (noticed by others or not) that I am really starting to see how much my mental health or possible neurodivergence is holding me back and causing me a lot of unwanted stress and pain.\n\nSo, I think it will bring me some peace to have a better understanding of how my brain works, whether I have ADHD or not. I think especially my sensitivity to rejection has been preventing me from seeking this out further, because it's hard to admit you have a problem, and there's a lot of stigma surrounding mental health already.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to navigate this or has had a similar experience, I would really appreciate the input. Anything from how to bring it up to my therapist again (scary), to finding testing, to managing ADHD symptoms would be great. Have a good rest of your day all.",

        "post": "This is my first year of graduate school in an archaeology PhD program. I attend a uni that operates on a ~11-week quarterly system, and I have three graduate seminar classes that I'm taking this quarter that each require about 12 minimum to 20 max page papers that require you to do some bibliographic research on a topic related to the central themes of the class. At the moment, we're in Week 6, and these papers are due Week 11, so I have 5 weeks to do research and writing for 3 different papers.\n\nMy problem comes in how I can manage to crank out these papers in the time we have left while also balancing it with doing things like readings for weekly discussions, as well as the various other obligations and responsibilities grad school and life brings (Plus there's a healthy dose of procrastination tendencies that I know I need to break out of haha)\n\nSo I'm wondering - should I start writing these papers now? How long does it take to write, say, a 20 page seminar paper for you, including the time it takes to do research and reading? What would the best way to approach completing these papers keeping in mind all the other responsibilities I have as a grad student (like, dedicate one week to each paper, break up working on each into chunks, etc.)? I think I just need some advice on where to start, frankly. Thanks!",

The requirements aren't crazy as it has to be 40 pages and I'm not collecting data, I'll use secondary data.\n\nI'm also working currently so I don't have unlimited free time. But now I'm getting seriously worried the task isn't possible. I feel like I need to go into hardcore mode and spend all free time working on it. The task just seems so insurmontable (thus the anxiety that's gotten me into this place) and I'm terrified of failing and not being able to graduate.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?

I found one section incredibly useful in highlighting and changing some of my behaviors around social media, and I think it can help others as well. Here it is:\n\nMain causes of social media induced procrastination - according to the paper:\n\n* **Poor expectation management,** coming from beliefs like \u201cmy friends expect me to reply almost instantly, no matter the time\u201d.\n* **Impulsiveness and lack of self control.** For example, having to check you phone as soon as you receiving a notification.\n* **Poor time management.**\n* **Habitual checking,** i.e. social media purely out of habit, for example as the first thing you do in the morning. This behavior has increasingly been normalized.\n* **Social norms**, e.g. believing that procrastinating with social media is a ok because \u201ceverybody else does it\u201d.\n\nAnd here are some practices that can help you reduce social media induced procrastination:\n\n* **Avoid getting overly affected emotionally by what you see online**.

But I just don't even sometimes realize like how much phone I'm using and constantly staying on electronics. I don't really know how to deattach from this problem. I'm really feeling like I'm wasting critical time to learn new skills and leverage more opportunities because using phone has created short term attention span where watching 15 min about certain topic just feels off-putting. Can't even focus and implement what I read or watch but if it's social media then yeah obviously mind gets interested. It's just really causing negative impact and your mental emotional physical well being gets disrupted. Sometimes you realize internally like okay, get up time to do some work but you keep procrastinating saying 5 more mins that turns into 2 hours and youre just sitting in one place. Then once you come out of this phase, you ultimately start to feel self hatred and guilt.",

It\u2019s a time management technique that encourages people to work with the time that they have, rather than working against it. I HATE working against time and makes me feel pressured. But, just putting this timer on my screen didn\u2019t last for long, because it didn\u2019t really motivate me to keep on going.\nThen, I found this website called Hezy. When I went on there, it had pomodoro timer, but the killer was that there were other people who were working really hard. It has a moderator who oversees, but it was other people who were concentrating on whatever they were doing that motivated me. Seeing that there are other people who work really really hard to get done whatever they need to finish got me going.\ntbh, I also kinda wanna show off to people that im hard working and being on hezy proved to other people that i can be just as hardworking :)))\nanyways, this is just my quick personal tip for everyone on this sub",

I aslo like to participate in events including public speaking, presenting in front of the class and any other things that makes me the spotlight. I was also really confident about how i look and didn't care what everyone thinks.\n \n\nThen, the pandemic strikes. I completely forgot who i am, i was losing myself and being mentally ill. I dont like participating in online class, i procrastinate so bad and im not interested joining in extracurricular activities anymore. I gaslighted myself that my old me will come back when the pandemic ends.\n\nNow im in 9th grade and im still like my pandemic self. I dont know who I am anymore and when my teacher calls me to participate i completely block out. I also hate how i look and im so insecure about myself. Pls help me.\n\n",

        "post": "I've always been a person that had trouble studying. Procrastinating and then doing all the work last minute was my way to go. So why would I change it right? Well, I wish I hadn't thought that way because from that point on, it would continue to be a habit that would plague me for years to come. Fast-forward a bit, and we're in late 2019. I started a new  course and thought maybe I can change my ways now, only for my world to come crashing down as a pandemic was announced months later. I think I don't need to say how much the pandemic worsened my habits... but miraculously after 3 years, I still graduated (probably due to everything being less strict and school/teachers still having to find their way around the pandemic) anyway. Three years pass, and I decide to go to uni to do a 4-year CS course (obviously since I didn't learn shit at my previous course). The same routine plays out: I fail exams, and I have to retake them. And then suddenly a switch flipped around last weekend. I had nothing to do and knew I had exams for the upcoming week, so I decided to do something I haven't done in years: seriously studying. And guys, when I tell you that I had an epiphany that weekend, I really did. Suddenly, all the years of feeling like I'm wasting my life or not doing anything vanished. I knew what I was missing: A goal. Something to work towards, up until that point, it just felt like I was living an aimless existence. I genuinely felt so much joy when I was actually studying and not because of the act of studying itself, but because I was actually learning new things. Things that I had heard a thousand times in a classroom, that seemed like white noise before, actually started to make sense to me. I was genuinely gaining knowledge and understanding what I was doing. I don't think I've been that hyped up for anything up until that point. And while I was relishing in my newfound joy, I had a sad realization: \"Why the hell didn't I do this earlier?\" I damn near studied my butt off that weekend, but I'll probably still fail. Cause the content wasn't something you could just clear in a weekend (some probably could but not me) but in a way I'm still happy, because now I can work my way to studying consistently. So guys please, all of you struggling with procrastination: I know how hard it is, and sometimes the hardest part is starting to begin with, but I promise you once you pick up your notes/books laptop etc. And you find yourself actually learning/understanding things, you'll genuinely want to keep studying. Don't wait anymore, don't look back on the time you've already wasted. No longer will you say \"I'll do it one day\". Let's make today, Day 1.\n\nTLDR: After years of not studying due to procrastination habit, I finally tried it out and beat myself up for not doing it earlier. Trust me it's worth it.",

        "post": "For as long as I can remember, I've always sucked at school. I'm pretty slow when it comes to learning and have gotten bad grades starting the 4th grade, which significantly got worse all throughout High School. Not for the lack of trying, because I did try, but I'll admit I don't exactly know how to study and I don't remember a time where I ever actually did study seriously. I almost didn't march up the stage for my High School graduation because of how bad my grades were, so when I actually got to, I vowed and swore to myself that college would be different. Or at least that's what I thought.\n\nTurns out, college was even worse because it dawned on me after my first year that my passion was in writing and not art. I couldn't change courses/track/majors because of financial problems so I told myself to suck it up and just get through three more years. Then I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression my second year, I failed a lot of classes, and so three years became four. I'm now on my sixth year, a semester away to graduating, but this pandemic and the lack of structure has made me realize that maybe I wasn't just dumb (something people in High School had associated me with) but that I was extremely lazy too.\n\nThe thing is, I was already performing badly during the normal school setting. When the rest of the semester got canceled and switched to online, I became even worse. I ended up never turning in a few requirements even though I knew the deadlines and consequences (I got an 'Incomplete' as my grade so it was more or less an extension to submit my missing works), and I also forgot about the existence of a subject (which is just crazy to me, but I genuinely forgot and I didn't end up submitting a single thing for the class and was marked 'Never Entered' which meant I had to take the class again, technically an F). If it was a normal school semester I definitely would've failed these classes but circumstances had professors lenient. When I found out about the status of my grades, you'd expect that someone would get right on to the overdue work, turn it in, and just fix it, right? I didn't do shit. I let it sit there for a month until my parents were eventually notified. Now it's been another month since they found out and my dad keeps asking me if I've heard from my 2 professors who gave me an 'Incomplete' and if they finally gave me a grade since \u201cI've submitted my missing works.\u201d Wrong. I compulsively lied again and again; I actually haven't started any of the requirements. It's been almost 3 months but I haven't submitted anything, and have just been stalling.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me. I know I should be doing them, but I always seem to get distracted and do something else \u2013 case in point, I finally got the energy to start on the paper but it hasn't even been 5 minutes till I decided that writing this down would be a better use of my time. I always wake up first thing in the morning with the best intentions, I obsessively make lists of things I want to do for the day but never end up going through with them. Procrastinating is the only thing that works for me (until recently, when I started not giving a shit about deadlines either). I always do things till the last second, I literally don't know any other way to do things. And it just sucks, because it seems like all I do is try and try but never actually *do*.\n\nSchool is starting in a few weeks and I'm worried of screwing up this last semester. I want to graduate, but it also got me thinking about the future when I finally get a job. Will I always be this undisciplined and lazy, with no work ethic? I feel so pathetic and dysfunctional. Doing things just get so excruciating sometimes that it's almost crippling and I'm just really really struggling, I don't know how else to deal with this.",

        "post": "* Went back to college during pandemic after going through at least 3 gap years\n* Went through high school easily without doing much (though granted, I also slept poorly all throughout that time, so I thought that was the reason I struggled to even concentrate during classes), the only topic I studied a decent amount for was math in order to get through the tests, but other than that, I didn't learn that much about studying properly in that time. Graduated with good grades, internet browsing habit (alternating between that and gaming, while now it's usually just the former) continued\n* During the gap years I explored various topics, especially ones that I am most fond of, namely art and creative-related things\n* During this time I entertained the thought of going to art school numerous times, and even gave it a shot once, but with the volume of applicants I didn't get through, so that led to another gap year. I eventually decided it would be a good idea to work part-time while still having enough money to do and afford things, and have the free time to work on my creative pursuits. So with a mild interest in software development, I decided to go for that\n* Diagnosed OCD and suspected ADHD but not diagnosed, so in any case, want to do anything I can to steer this ship right\n\nBasically, I'm finding it very difficult to consistently study and motivation seems lackluster, scraping by with just about the bare minimum, some days my head hurting from trying to do more. Like constantly bumping into an invisible wall and my brain just refusing to work with me. I'm in the second semester now and I was already behind in the first, feeding to the pressure, especially now that I'm the newest addition of the semester's best team. Worked on developing more discipline often, and while that has gotten better over time, in the broadest sense it somehow just refuses to stick. Also figuring out how to get more organized but that too feels daunting, feeling that I must now become nearly perfectly organized in order for it to be enough. Something just won't click. There's a general fear of failure I can identify, there's a seeking-distractions problem, and it's been so hard just to steer this ship right, and keep it right whenever it was going right for a while. I've worked with pomodoros, which I find to be quite efficient, but it doesn't fix the broader problem. This study course has no grading system (only a test at the end of every semester), so you're pretty much reliant on gauging how well you're doing by comparing yourself to other students, some of which do far more than is needed, which makes it all the more daunting. I also have an annoying and strong tendency to aim for perfection, feeling the strong need to do so, for whatever reason, and this only fuels the fear of failure. At times I almost feel as if I must do everything right immediately, or else it's not good, even though I know, logically, that that is not the way things work and that you gotta start somewhere. It's still some subconscious thing, it seems... And procrastination often goes hand in hand with a fear of failure or something of that ilk.\n\nIs there a mindset problem at work here or could this actually be ADHD judging by my given descriptions? I feel like I keep being at odds with myself, not only in this area but others also, though over the years things have improved (even though they haven't done so as fast as I would want). I also feel a great divide between school and the creative goals I've established during the past years, and one can guess which I'd much rather be working on, but to have a proper financial foundation I'm gonna have to get through my studies as well.\n\nTried to keep it compact but it still turned out being a giant wall of text, the given details seemed necessary for the context. If anyone with experience or ideas about this could give me some suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.",

I'm on track to fail a class for the first time in my life (there is still hope though, so fingers crossed).* \n\n*For some reason, my productivity took a Niagra Falls dip this summer: difficulty starting up a study session, low energy, procrastination...you name it. I couldn't figure out why. Simply shrugged it off as inevitable burnout and \"oh it's COVID blah blah\".*\n\nThat is until I had a r/showerthoughts moment this morning. You see, I'm an avid sports gamer.   I play daily, always enjoy battling it out online (FIFA, NHL, what have you). Now since real sports have been out of action, my interest in gaming (I only play sports games) also coincidentally stopped. \n\nThis is where I put two and two together. Pre-covid, I would always fire up a couple games in the morning. It gets my competitive juices flowing. It focuses me. After my few games, I'm alert.  I'm sharp. Not to mention some confidence boost from crushing one of my online opponents :P. I'm ready to be productive and take this energy into my study sessions. \n\nNow because this was an unconscious routine I developed, I didn't even notice this was out of my life until my epiphany moment. Seeing how classes probably going to be online this coming fall (and god forbid into 2021), we gotta adapt and figure out our shit out. \n\n**Moral of the story:** if you struggled like me this summer, analyze your routines and habits. Is there some unconscious pre-covid habit that got you fired up and was subsequently was taken away without it consciously registering? And if you didn't have anything pre-covid, maybe think about finding something? Being productive isn't necessarily allowing yourself to only do \"productive\" things.",

And I try to do more, it's just that I look at my homework and can't immediately understand it, so I decide to procrastinate and do something easier. This procrastination is getting so bad that I can't bring myself to practice my hobbies anymore. All I can do is scroll endlessly, late into the night.\n\nI've tried to block the offending websites on my computer but I always think \"oh maybe I'll take a break just this once, go on reddit for 5 mins and then back to my homework...\" You know where that goes. Seriously, I don't know what to do, especially because I've been hiding it from my parents and they'll freak if they find out. I'm just desperate for any sort of advice. Thanks so much.",

        "post": "Hi, I am an university student who failed a grade because during covid I really couldn't get myself to study because I couldn't get myself motivated without being in the presence of hardworking students. But because of those two difficult years I really got this anxiety (?) to study. Like I am not bad at memorizing, but I study very slow in comparison to my sister (a genius) and my friends. (I've got this bad habit to redo all the summaries I made during the year because I just can't stand my ugly writing (if it's made on the computer, I will still write one down))\n\nBecause I study by writing things down or explaining it to myself I tend to have a shortage of time (I am a snail -\\_- ) and then I start to panic, get literally sick because of the fear and sometimes even cancel the exam (worst thing you could ever do), making me even be afraid to start studying because \"It's impossible anyways\". And then... I start procrastinating while feeling sick.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for me? Does an online study buddy really help? And if so how does it work?\n\nThanks",

So we made a [comparison](https://www.pocketcoach.co/blog/anxiety-vs-coronavirus-symptoms/) of the symptoms, as well as techniques to help you differentiate between anxiety and the coronavirus.\n\nCurious what you guys think and if you find it helpful.

I've so much to study and I've no idea how I'm gonna do all that in 18 days. I really want good results because I want to prove myself to everyone who looked down at me in school. I know I wasted a lot of time and I know it's impossible for me to get 9As in my upcoming mocks. \n\nI have my IGCSE's in 3-4 months and I know can get 9As if I really work hard now. But I'm scared I'll just waste my time just like I'm doing for my mocks now. Each time I get motivated I'm afraid that I won't be motivated the same the next day and go back to my procrastination cycle. \n\nI used to be a topper before covid happened and now I'm the bottom 5 of my class. I've teachers asking me what happened and I go home feeling low the entire day. Everyone around me are so motivated about getting 9As and I am too, but I'm really far behind. My classmates look down on me as being just a below average student and I'm not used to this feeling. People who were friends with me when I was a topper are not even talking to me anymore. \n\nI'm so confused between doing past papers, taking notes and reading textbooks so that I can finish studying my syllabus. I'm struggling between trying to find a proper study method and actually studying (example: i try to do past papers but then when I actually sit down to do them I realise that I \"don't know how to do past papers effectively\"). I watch lots of study vlogs on YouTube to get motivated and that motivation lasts only for like 2 days and I'm stuck in my cycle of endless scrolling and procrastination. I just know I'm avoiding my tasks because I'm overwhelmed. I feel like doing everything else other than studying (i guess i just have too many interests). But I also know I want 9As and that I want to be a high achiever. \n\nEverytime I try to study I keep on thinking about the vastness of my syllabus. I know it's not as much as uni courses but still it's a lot for the time I have (especially for someone who barely concentrated in class and I hate myself for not doing so). And that's when everything crashes down on me and I leave my desk to avoid studying. \n\nI would be really grateful if anyone would tell me what to do and if they have been in a similar situation as me, because I really don't want to be like this again. \n\n I'm really hopless at this point and it makes me think about my future if I'm gonna be the same then too.\n\nI really would appreciate your advices for my ADHD brain. \n\nThanks! :)",

Please hold me accountable.\"*\n\nIf you want to make it even more effective, you can set up a contract between yourself and your friend that both of you sign.\n\nHere's why the strategy works so well:\n\nWe tend to procrastinate because of negative emotions around a task. We believe the task will be painful in some way. So we avoid it.\n\nThe strategy I just described leverages urgency,  social pressure, and your aversion to the consequences to make **procrastination more painful than doing the thing.**\n\nSo you take action.\n\nI hope this strategy helps.

Lately its been really hard to wake up and I've just been wasting a lot of my days in social media and as a result not only have I fallen behind, but my grades took a permanent hit. I am a university student and feel like this kind of behavior should be behind me. But I just feel guilty that I have fallen behind and procrastinate on different things to escape the feeling of guilt. How do I get out of this rut?",

        "post": "Im struggling with studying since my second year of high school and I believe it's going worse with time, I am now 21 on my third year on uni (I failed two years on CS first year and restarted again on a language uni) and I had a good start with nice grades to then drop the grip once more.\nI can't get myself to follow lessons, to study constantly, everytime I try to open a book I either have a panic attack or can't focus properly.\nOf course I'm not here for mental advice, I believe this is not something to ask here, but what I want to ask is advices to keep my motivation going.\nI honestly don't know what I like doing, I thought I liked languages but it's worrying that I still can't get myself to study them, I had excitement at first but it didn't last that much, I believe I'm also someone capable and smart sometimes but I just can't or I just forget  how to study properly.\n\nFocusing is hard, and so is keeping motivation. It's not a matter of distractions I believe because even when I don't have anything around I still can't absorb whatever I am studying, I'm also a really bad procrastinator and I don't study constantly at all, going for small bursts to nothing to last minute study, which is not a good thing.\nWith my yearly exam in languages coming up soon I am now panicking because I technically have to start studying now the whole study plan of one whole year where I barely attended lessons and im trying to seek the mindset to finally start and get some work done.\n\nIt has probably something to do with my mental health, as I said, struggling by being at depression door (not diagnosed yet so I don't want to assume, although it feels pretty close. I do experience anxiety often although), I realize that is an issue to be addressed first but what about recovering the mature and responsability of studyng, the motivation and the right etiquette, do you guys think you can help me with it? Give me the strenght or courage? Realistically I know I shouldn't have done what I did but, I want to be told it is still possible  to recover and because of that I  want to hear of stories of people in my similar situation, want to read them as a source of motivation, to feel less alone in this mess. \n\nPlease, tell me about a similar situation to this and how you overcame it, it would give me great strenght and inspiration.",

I know it comes down to the person and taking action, but I have very weak willpower at the moment, and a lot of work to do. Anything would be helpful, resources, motivation ideas, discipline regiments, anything.\n\nI will add a bit of context for personal reasons: I go to a academicly rigorous high school (I'm a freshman) that's lasts for 8 hrs a day, 8:00 am to 4:10 pm, but I live so far away that I'm leaving home at 6:50 am to arrive (I wake up at 5:00 am) and don't get home till about 5:00 pm. My parents \"try\" to help me by enforce my a bed time of 10:30, so I have a time constraint, and i will never ever be able to pull an all nighter. I also struggle with anxiety/stress that turns into physical illness at times (not as bad as it sounds), but I'm also a perfectionist who lives off academic validation, so it gets complicated.\n\n I'm looking for litterly anything that could help or discipline me to get work done more. I have so much to do, and it's only gonna pile up if I don't take action, but I feel like forcing myself to do it right now might burn me out worse, and I feel weak and pathetic, and would like some guidance or tips please \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc.\n\nTLDR: I'm stressed with a lot of work but little time each day and am looking for any tips that may help me, motivate me, or discipline me.",

I've been dealing with depression for the last few years (complicated situation at home, some difficult time in the past), so I got an option of an additional year, so I could graduate (bachelor degree).  All I have done in the last year is one exam. I still have most of my thesis and one very difficult oral exam left. Also, I have around 10 long novels left to read (I'm studying linguistics and literature). I'm supposed to know them in detail. This exam is tomorrow and I know only maybe a quarter of what I should know. There one more exam date at the beginning of the September, which is still very soon.\n\nThe thing is, I've had more than enough time to prepare for the exam and write my thesis, but whenever I started thinking about it, I lost all motivation, I felt so much pressure and anxiety, that I couldn't do anything. So I procrastinated for a whole year and tried to pretend that my study obligations don't exist, but I was really just subconsciously stressed most of the time. I'm still feeling this way right now, well, actually worse. \n\nThere are some more things that don't really help:\n\n\\- I have an excessive need for perfection.\n\n\\- If I don't graduate, I have to pay the tuition (otherwise is cost-free) and can't get to the master level.\n\n\\- I have a complicated relationship with my thesis tutor, as she has been sexually abusive to my friend for the past year. I'm quite afraid of her. It's a fucked up situation, still in process.\n\n\\- My family members don't really get what depression is.\n\n\\- I couldn't afford to pay for a therapist, I've had some free therapy, that was provided by my university, it was quite good, but only once every 4 or 5 weeks, which was way too have a for me.\n\nI feel like a big loser, what should I do?\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post": "Since December I\u2019ve been caught up in a serious funk because of the pandemic. Typical me does very well with online learning and pre-covid, I had already taken one online class in high school and one in my very first semester in college, and both were accelerated. I did great in both. However, it seems like the motivation and grit I once had are completely done. I'm a fierce planner but I haven't planned for anything since a few months ago and everything I\u2019ve done had been procrastinated on or just done on the whim. I've tried switching up where I worked (ex. going to a cafe instead), background noise, those \u201cstudy with me\u201d videos, cutting my time on social media in half (probably more than that at this point), and a few other things. I just can't seem to stick to a strict schedule like I used to. \n\nIt used to be so easy but even starting the most simple assignments feels like a chore. I've tried to seek counseling and have called at least 30 different numbers since February but every place seems to have a huge waitlist or their counselors aren't taking any new clients, or they just don't pick up at all. I'm not at a happy point in my life even if a seem to \u201cact like it.\u201d I still eat 2-3 square meals a day, hang out with friends sometimes, and do household chores.  It's just when it comes to schoolwork I can't seem to buckle down and grind it out like I used to and I miss that. I just feel so empty-headed and there's so much brain fog. I'm not feeling myself. My head is not in the right space at all. I've been told to try to \u201cjust take things one step at a time\u201d and my mom has tried to give me some advice, like breaking my work time up into shorter periods like the Pomodoro technique, but I did even want to so that. I just want to be able to sit and grind it out like I used to. My attention span used to be so long and now it's short and I can't seem to regain my focus. It's like I'm not trying very hard to fix myself at the moment. I tried a lot harder to fix myself in December over winter break but that didn't work either and I'm not sure why. I'm so stuck and so ready to get out of this rut. I'm frustrated with myself. My thoughts are getting a bit dark, too. I know that dwelling on how I was in the last isn't helping me and I need some solutions. I even thought a little outside the box a couple days ago to start my own live Twitch stream if me just working to both motivate myself and others, but I thought I sounded so silly. I wouldn't even know how to promote myself on there and I don't want to waste too much time on something that could be temporary. \n\nSince the pandemic I've been in these types of bouts before, but they were much shorter and it wasn't this severe; currently, it's been five months. My motivation, since a year ago, seems to rise and fall, and when it falls, it\u2019s really bad. We\u2019ve all procrastinated but the extent I'm doing it to is quite unhealthy. I'm scatterbrained and stressed out to the point I had a dizzy spell in my dance class a couple nights ago. So what is this, just some brain fog of something deeper and much worse?",

        "post": "&#x200B;\n\nI used to put things off all the time when I was in school and during my first year of uni.\n\nI'd delay studying or working on projects until the last minute, and the stress of deadlines was the only thing that got me moving.\n\nI'd tell myself that I did my best work under pressure, but really, I was just stuck in a cycle of stress.\n\nProcrastination was eating away at my potential. I felt guilty, my self-esteem took a hit, and it made me downright miserable. So, I decided I didn't want to live like that anymore. I had to change something.\n\nSo I spent ages digging into why we procrastinate, diving into the psychology and science behind it all. Then, I started trying out different strategies based on what I'd learned.\n\nGuess what?  I've mostly overcome the habit now, and it's made a huge difference in my life.\n\nNow I want to [share the strategies that changed my life:](https://timetactix.beehiiv.com/subscribe)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** **Know What's Up:** Procrastination isn't just about poor time management or laziness. It's about emotions - associating negative feelings like fear or overwhelm with a task, so you avoid it. Our brains are wired this way, but it doesn't help us in the modern world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Name That Feeling:** When you're itching to procrastinate, figure out why. Sometimes just putting a name to that fear or whatever it is can make it less intimidating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3.** **Baby Steps**: Break big tasks into smaller, doable chunks. It's way easier to start when you know exactly what you're aiming for. Like, don't try to write a whole paper - just start with the first 200 words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Plan It Out:** Make clear plans for when and where you'll do something. Saying \"I will do (this thing) at (this place) at (this time)\" really helps. Research shows it seriously boosts follow-through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Think About Failing:** Sounds weird, but picturing how bad it'd feel to fail at your goal can push you to work when you're not feeling it. We hate losing more than we love winning, so it's a good motivator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease remember that beating procrastination takes time.\n\nThese strategies aren't a quick fix, but if you stick with them, you'll get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**P.S**.

        "post": "My roommate, who i admire and appreciate greatly, embodies very studious and healthy traits. You know the daily 8 hrs of sleep, nutritious meals, and many hours of studying. Me on the other hand finds it hard to do simple tasks, starts homework at 1 am, and gets an avg of 5 or less hours of sleep to finish said work. Ive noticed lately her sentiment towards my behavior is one of judgement and disbelief. I know it comes from a good place but it feels like she thinks i am dumb or lazy. For some reason, the idea of \"just start\" for homework doesnt work EVER. Ill often sit in front of my computer for the whole day but not type a single word. If I remove my phone as a distraction ill draw instead. It is 2 am right now and i am writing a reddit post instead of doing my work (which Ive had all day to do).  \n\n Its just incredibly frustrating. I know that my roommate wants to help but when she says something like \"you wanna start on your work?\", in a condescending tone, it ends up making me upset (though i dont show it and respond with a \"you right thanks\"). She does it a lot and now it feels like shes only talking to me or looking at me to make sure that I am doing something she deems productive (asian mom style iykyk). What sucks is that i DO feel dumb and stupid for not being able to do simple things and that shes right in that i should \"just start\". When i keep procrastinating after she catches me not doing work i feel like im letting her down as well because im not only failing myself but i am also worrying her. \n\nTRUST me when i say that ive heard and tried all of the \"how to not procrastinate tips\". Ive made schedules, lists, reduced distractions, looked into why i feel the way that i do, and what exactly am i trying to avoid to no avail. I feel stressed, tired, pathetic, and stupid for not being able to do what seemingly everyone else can. Im constantly sleep deprived because I either have homework to do or am trying to maximize my time awake to do the things that I want to do. I also have nothing to worry about outside of my first world problems. School workload is doable with only 5 hrs a day of studying, no job, no bitches, money is good, so its even more embarrasing that im struggling this much. \n\nIts frustrating for someone so close to make you feel ashamed for something that feels out of your control . Vice versa its frustrating trying to help someone who is going through something that seems so miniscule thats easily fixable. \n\nI still love my roommate like crazy and I know shes coming from a good place so ive got no beef with her (childhood friends so we chill like that). Just feels like she doesn't get the struggle if that makes sense. \n\nIt feels very self centered to think that no one else is going through this but it definitely feels like it irl. **If anyone has any insight that would be nice**. \n\n&#x200B;",

I am literally just staring at a blank document at the moment, so I know I need to find a more structured approach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT for all in a similar situation: I'm about 3 hours away from the deadline and believe it or not, I've managed to get at least 2000 words onto a document. Not all of the words are organized correctly yet. I've got to make sure that my ideas make sense and reiterate my arguments. But I just wanted to say, that you can do it! Not going to lie, it's been a pretty miserable 48 hours trying to muster up the energy and brainpower to get this done. For all those in future predicaments, please just push through and you will find a way to make it happen. **Do not give up**!

So far I\u2019ve been able to essentially not digest and learn content until max 3 days but usually fewer days before a midterm or even final.

        "post": "Context: I'm a high/secondary school student. In my earlier days, I used to work hard, but once I reached secondary school, I kind of gave up. I'm in the highest-ranked school in my country, and being grouped with the smartest kids in the country makes me feel pressured. I also got my phone and opened up to gaming. However, being in an elite school brings very harsh studying routines, learning topics that students from other schools learn later on in their studies. I think I'm not a very special or smart kid, and it is seen in my results, which arguably are decent, except for Math and Science, the two subjects where I worry whether I will pass or fail.\n\nSo here comes: I hate studying for these two subjects, and I have no motivation to pursue the subjects. The issue is - for a good future, I have to do well in them, from the words of literally everyone. Except for talent-related jobs like acting or singing, which I'm not pursuing. Hence, I gave up trying... and this is a huge issue. I'm failing in the two even more, and disappointing my parents more. DO NOT get me wrong, I love my parents, and they are nice people who I strive to make them happy, and make myself happy too. Yet, I'm now demoralised, not even trying to score well, with the mindset, \"Yeah I'm screwed\". Looking at everyone do well, while I disappoint myself and everyone I love again and again, and I say \"I will try harder\" and I forget everything. Repeat cycle.\n\nThe issue is procrastination, the idea of \"I'll do this tomorrow\" again and again. I'm also distracted all the time, wandering away to my own world. I tried the very generic methods, like putting your phone far far away but I somehow always end up distracted with something else.\n\nMy main problem is: I have no life goal. And hence I see no goal in studying. To be frank: I see no purpose in life and I'm living it because... I don't know why.  \n\n\nWhat exactly is studying, and how do I do it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;Dr - I hate studying, and I'm not even trying, because I see no point, but I don't have an ambition either. What now?",

        "post": "Hello everyone who's struggling with procrastrination. I'm currently an university student and to be honest I'm the laziest person ever, mostly skipping everything till the very last moment and often failing.\n\nLast year I failed mathematical analysis and had to repeat it this year. I could even later but I was convinced the faster, the better (because if I fail, I fail faster). Our mathematical analysis consisted of 3 tests before final exam. Each test had 15 points and we had to get at least 20 for final exam.\n\nSo, year started. I was thinking I got this, until first exam.\n\n2 points. 2 points out of 15. I remember I was nervous and shaking, doing stupid stuff and damaging myself in the long run by myself (for some reason in a formula type n^2 - n I made a change to n^2 - 1).\n\nSecond test began. I knew I need minimally three points to keep going. I prepared a bit and went there. The day I wrote the test I quickly found out I messed up and went to speak with teacher the moment class ended. He said he thinks I could get 3 points but has to see closely. Then I went to my work and saw an email from my teacher: \"I'm sorry but you used the methods incorrectly and I give you 0 points. Good luck.\".\n\nI began shaking, dying inside. I had no plan what to do if I fail university. So I reached out back to him, told him I am nervous and have problems with control and asked if we can make a deal about 3 points. He told me to see him. I told my boss I'm leaving for school (he was ok with it). When I met my teacher at university, he gave me the easiest problem from the paper to solve to proove I am capable of solving that. It was simple, but I kept doing random mistakes which he wanted to explain why it doesn't work. After focusing I made it, and my teacher told me that I might be hurting myself if I don't know this, that it is a simple test. He also told me he grants me the three points needed.\n\nThe last test was on 18th december. It was 17th december when I found out I didn't study. I knew I'm going to fail. Getting 15 points out of 15 seemed impossible at this point. There was no chance. My logic told me I'm just pushing away the inevitable. But I wrote my teacher an email that I won't arrive on the test due to personal problems - I did this to push the test further, on an alternate date. I did not want to fail the university before Christmas so my father is not sad (he is happy for where I'm studying). So I did.\n\nIt was two days before the alternate date test. I noticed that a different teacher will be there with us. After having no motive to do nothing, I started my university's math problem generator and for two days (around 10-15 hours in total) I just did what it gave me. It was around 150-200 problems, but I felt that I still have my weak points.\n\nThen the day came. It was 5th January and I knew that it is the day I will remember. It was the day the fate will play it's cards. However I was already convinced I'm not going to get 15 points. Everybody told me it's impossible and I didn't believe myself.\n\nI woke up, went to school. Took a seat, the paper was in front of me and I started solving. When I saw it all, I thought to myself that I expected much worse. Derivations and Taylor polynome was acceptable for me. I started writing and after few moments I thought I'm making a mistake at the Taylor polynome which was a form of T3 = 1. I have never seen this polynome so I looked to the people next to me. One had written \"x^3\" while the other one had nothing. I thought I should write \"x^3\" cause it felt like it made sense to me, but eventually I didn't.\n\nI left the classroom, thinking I'm going to get 7-8 points. I was very sad already planning what to do and what to say at home. I had another subject then which I didn't pay attention to. After that one I visited the teacher. He said he is in a rush, but the tests are checked. I remember I thought to myself \"if I get 13-14 points, I might try bargaining\". He found my test and when I saw it, I took a deep breathe and I couldn't believe it. I think my reaction was comical.\n\nI made it.\n\nI somehow made it.\n\nI got 15 points out of 15, and my life is fixed.\n\nI was so happy I was thinking I'm gonna call somebody but I didn't. Well now, I'm 100% sure I am capable of impossible, of illogical. And I think everybody really is.\n\nTL;DR - Screwed up tests, thought that finishing OK is impossible/illogical and was prepared for leaving uni - last test before final exam was OK and my hope was restored despite not really believeing it at first.",

I usually played some pc games or wasted time with social media when I was supposed to be studying.\n\nNow, I would like some tips for this year. I am going to be studying at university and working part-time (8 AM to 1 PM) Monday to Friday, and going to classes and studying in the afternoo, so my time will be scarce.\n\nAny tips for maximizing productivity, dead times, zero procrastination, etc.?\n\nI really appreciate it.\n\nThanks!",

But this wasn't such a problem because I always managed to get things done. In retrospect, I only scraped through things and didn't put in all my efforts. In school and eventually in uni, I have always been a good student securing good grades but only I know how much I delayed things and have had to face a very bad burnout after each exam. But the sad part is I just don't seem to learn from my past mistakes. I still delay my tasks to the very last moment because in the back of my head I know that I can get it done (proven from past experiences). I really wish for this cycle to stop. I'll read about productivity, apply a few techniques and get bored too soon and get sucked into the spiral of wasting time. I have a feeling that I do this just to avoid the pain of doing a task that's not so exciting (studying) and guilt (as a result of wasting time). When I decide to focus on one thing, it becomes increasingly hard as I get bored very soon. I have started hobbies in great spirit and left them midway.\n\nBut this time it's different. I know that I really need to study for this exam which will be an important determinant for my career but I just can't get myself to do so. The list of things to tick off from the study list is endless and this induces anxiety. I often wonder if I'll be able to achieve my goals in life because of my inconsistencies despite other people telling me time and again that I can. Even when I work very hard and things go great, I'll often worry about the end result.\n\nHow can I fix this broken mindset and start working towards my goal?",

        "post": "Im in year 11 in an Australian high school. I started a few days ago and I\u2019ve quickly realised that I procrastinate way too much. I\u2019m very academically smart (I was top of my grade last year) but I didn\u2019t even need to study to do that. I obviously need to actually study this year, but for some reason I can\u2019t start studying.\n\nI\u2019ve been assigned to do two chapters of a math textbook, each with 20 exercises in them, but it takes me one hour to do one exercise. Not because they are hard questions, but because I\u2019m procrastinating too much. I sit at my desk and just stare at the wall or focus too much on how neat I\u2019m writing. I\u2019m starting to worry because if I don\u2019t start studying today or tomorrow I will fall behind.\n\nHow do I start studying? I know people will say \u201cjust do it!\u201d but how??? Even when I get up, put my phone in a different room, set up my desk and everything is ready for me to study, I just can\u2019t. The only time I can actually do work is during school where I have to because the teacher is there with me. I can\u2019t study at a library or public space because I live too far away from them and I have strict parents.\n\nSo I guess the question is, how do I fight procrastination??",

        "post": "If you are having trouble managing your time during your daily academic activities? these, following strategies can help you.\n\nHere are six effective time management strategies for academic success:\n\n1. **Create a Schedule:** Develop a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule that includes dedicated study blocks for each subject or task. Allocate specific time slots for studying, assignments, and other activities.\n2. **Prioritize Tasks:** Identify and prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency. Focus on completing high-priority tasks first to ensure that critical assignments and exams are given sufficient attention.\n3. **Set Realistic Goals:** Set achievable goals for each study session and break larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. This helps to maintain motivation and a sense of accomplishment as you progress.\n4. **Avoid Procrastination:** Procrastination can lead to unnecessary stress and last-minute rushes. Combat it by breaking tasks into smaller steps, using time-blocking techniques, and employing strategies like the Pomodoro Technique (working in focused bursts with short breaks).\n5. **Eliminate Distractions:** Minimize distractions during study sessions by creating a conducive environment. Turn off notifications on your phone, find a quiet study space, and consider using website blockers or productivity apps to stay focused.\n6. **Take Breaks and Rest:** Allow yourself regular breaks during study sessions to rejuvenate your mind. Short breaks can enhance productivity and prevent burnout. Additionally, ensure you get enough sleep each night to maintain overall well-being and optimize cognitive function.\n\nBy implementing these time management strategies, you can effectively utilize your study time, stay organized, and enhance your academic success. Remember, finding the strategies that work best for you may require some experimentation and adjustments along the way.",

I've always struggled with setting concrete habits and keeping that, therefore leading to a constant cycle of either I completely just don't care about grades and extracurriculars and whatnot for a solid month and focus on myself, and then go back to having extremely high academic expectations for myself. I come from a competitive high school so it's difficult to even consider adding a bit of self improvement time in your schedule; not to mention my lack of *not procrastinating* skills still evident in my daily schedule.\n\nI have a few goals that I would like to achieve throughout my school career - 1. Graduate proud and go to a good university 2. Workout and improve social aspects of my life 3.

        "title": "How to research for a paper when you've procrastinated all of your time away - A Veteran's Guide",
        "post": "Hey all,\n\nHope you\u2019re all doing well. As we\u2019re now deep into exam season and I\u2019m sure a lot of you are pressed for time, I thought I\u2019d share my method on how to research when you\u2019ve left it too late and you\u2019re swiftly running out of time (we\u2019ve all been there!). Luckily, you can still conduct quality research even when you\u2019re against the clock \u2013 here\u2019s my method, tried and tested over 6+ years of writing essays.\n\n1. **Determine your answer to the question/essay BEFORE you start research.** This step is so fundamentally opposite to how students are taught to research, but if you\u2019re working on a time constraint it\u2019s essential. Say your question is something like, I don\u2019t know, \u201cHow far was Martin Luther King\u2019s Washington speech the most important moment in the civil rights movement?\u201dFrom this question we already know there are going to be two valid answers \u2013 It was the most important, it wasn\u2019t the most important. Pick one and stick with it \u2013 as we\u2019re strapped for time, we don\u2019t have the luxury of changing our mind.\n2. **Write down a rough plan of your answer/essay.** Again, completely antithetical to standard academic practice. However, writing down how your essay will progress will help us quickly identify important parts in the research we\u2019ll do.So, based on the above question, we might just write a really simply argument \u2013 counter-argument structure. I.e. The first half of your essay would display evidence about why it might be the most important moment, and the second half would be about why it wasn\u2019t.\n3. **Finding research.** Hopefully your professor/tutor has given you some pointers to begin your research. If not, [read my researching guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/cy85pg/how_to_effectively_research_for_an_academic_essay/) to get you started.\n4. **Use your plan to cut corners.** Before you begin reading, refer back to the plan you wrote before you start reading. Think about what you\u2019re looking for \u2013 you should be aiming to merely fill in the gaps in your plan, not trying to understand the nuances of the argument and evidence.Using our example, we\u2019d be looking for minimal facts and figures, but rather author\u2019s arguments as to why the march was or wasn\u2019t the most important moment in the civil rights movement.\n5. **Read the Introduction and Conclusion first**. If we\u2019re against the clock, we need to cut corners smartly and efficiency. As we\u2019re mostly looking for author *arguments*, NOT facts and figures, we can simply look to the intro and conclusion. The truth is that the author will give away their thesis in these sections \u2013 the rest of the article is usually just evidence supporting these overall theses.Once you\u2019ve identified their argument, write it down in the relevant section in your plan.\n6. **Skip whole paragraphs**. Determined that the author\u2019s argument is worth your time? Time to find the important evidence they use to argue it. This means you have to look at the \u201cbody\u201d of the article \u2013 but don\u2019t worry, we can skip most of this. Firstly, many authors use subtitles to divide their articles. Use this to guide your reading and decide which part will be most important. If they don\u2019t use dividers, look to the first and last sentence of each paragraph. This should give you an idea of what they\u2019re about.Judiciously decide which paragraphs will be worth your time and only read these, writing down the evidence you find into your plan.\n7. **Skim read**. So you\u2019ve narrowed down your reading to just sections or paragraphs. We can now begin \u201cskim reading\u201d. The easiest way to do this is to run your eyes over the section you have identified and look for key words or phrases. If we use our example as before, we might look for phrases such as \u201cMost significant\u201d, \u201cDefining moment\u201d, \u201cmost prolific\u201d, etc. Use your intuition here to think about what phrases or words author\u2019s might use when they\u2019re discussing topics relevant to your question/essay.\n8. **Write down all the evidence you find in your plan**. When you\u2019ve found the arguments and important evidence to support it, write it in the relevant part of the plan. Make sure you include the name of the author and the page number which each quote \u2013 this will save so much time when it comes to referencing.\n9. **Rinse and repeat**. Do this for each article you read, making sure you have enough arguments for each side in your plan. Within no time, you\u2019ll have summaries of articles in front of you divided into relevant and easy to digest sections. With this \u201cplan\u201d, you have all you need to [write a decent essay](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/f6tulz/how_to_write_an_academic_essay_a_guide_by_a/) that hides the fact you left it to the last minute. If you\u2019re not writing an essay, the \u201cplan\u201d can be used as a handy revision guide.\n\nI hope this guide helps \u2013 it\u2019s a method I\u2019ve been using for years when I\u2019m pressed for time. It is both highly efficient and ensures that your rushing/procrastination doesn\u2019t appear in your writing. Please let me know what you think and feel free to add any of your own methods in the comments!\n\nAll the best,\n\nDrew\n\n*P.S.

        "post": "I have been struggling with procrastination quite a while for now. I have my exams in a week And I don\u2019t know where to start. So I read many articles and watched videos on youtube. So now I am setting aside procrastination and working on my studies. Here are some things that helped me to get rid of procrastination for the time being ( at least for now)\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe **Step 1: Go ahead and admit that you feel some type of fear.**\n\nAll humans feel it, that\u2019s how we are wired. Fear has protected us and helped us survive. It has kept us on our toes, always on the lookout for danger and enemies and natural disasters, so that we can escape when we need to. And we often still feel that need to escape, even though we have come a long way from what our ancestors had to deal with every single day. But still, it\u2019s best to be aware of the feeling.\n\nQuestion to ask yourself:\n\n* What am I fearful about? Think what\u2019s at the core and say it out loud.\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe **Step 2: Resist your fixed mindset way of thinking.**\n\nSometimes it\u2019s that voice you hear saying, *I can\u2019t do this, I\u2019m going to give up!* If it is, that is your fixed mindset talking. What\u2019s a fixed mindset? It\u2019s your belief that your personality, skill set, and strengths are \u201cfixed\u201d i.e. you have them from birth, and that that\u2019s just how it is. What\u2019s better? Let your growth mindset do the talking. When you adopt a growth mindset, you start believing that you can cultivate strengths and skills through your efforts. The benefit? The things you tell yourself don\u2019t sound awful, and you give yourself the space to learn something new.\n\nQuestions to ask yourself:\n\n* Do I say something is difficult because I\u2019ve always told myself similar things are difficult? How would I change this if I could start all over again?\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe **Step 3: Remember how it was at the beginning.**\n\nWhatever you\u2019re working on, take a step back from your current situation and connect with the initial reason you started doing it. This will remind you of your initial personal or professional goals. Maybe you are studying for exams so you can get a degree that will open doors to an exciting career and financial independence. Or maybe you\u2019re looking for a job that is a better fit for your skill set and your career path than the last one you had.\n\nQuestions to ask yourself:\n\n* Why is this challenge so important to me? What is at the core? What will I gain from solving it? What will this mean to my life in the long run?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI share what I learn.

Its not a task for me like some  of my other colleagues, so if I sit for a tutorial or make a project, I  will love doing it.\n\nIts just that I  love other distractions too. I have a 10-7 job on weekdays and apart  from that job I want to study/ make projects for levelling up my skills.\n\nI  have a course that I am supposed to be doing, I also have a set of  topics that I need to study (probably daily one by one) in order to  prepare for my job interview. But most of the time I end up playing  Valorant or surfing instagram or wasting my time somewhere else. I also  have a girlfriend and I  need to make some time to talk to her too.  Right now, its like we talk every half hour or maybe not once for hours  but then multiple times in one hour, etc. I think this also distracts me  from studying as sometimes I am solving a question and she might  message at that very time only.\n\nTo  track my progress, I have made a excel wherein I put the questions that  I solved along with the date in green color and for days that I didn't  study, I put black rows. This has helped me get better than what I was  doing previously, but it is still not enough.\n\nSo,  how should I manage all these things? Talk to my gf, play game maybe  (not daily ofc) and study two different things regularly (project for  levelling up and study for job interview (daily))? How to manage my time  properly and not waste it?",

        "post": "**You have to take a deep breath and just begin.**\n\nI understand that this is frustrating. The first step in doing anything is usually the hardest one. But, it\u2019s doable \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of figuring out *how* to approach the problem. In this case, your first step is to change the way you think about this problem. Here\u2019s what I mean by that.\n\n**\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe First, adjust your MINDSET.**\n\nWhen we say, \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it\u201d we are giving priority to our emotions and therefore we have an emotional response to the problem. Where are the emotions coming from? Is it just your current mood or is this a typical reaction to this particular task or others similar to it? Is it a reaction that has become habitual every time you see your textbook? If the answer is yes, maybe it\u2019s your fixed mindset talking.\n\n* **What\u2019s a fixed mindset?** It\u2019s your belief that your skill set, your strengths, and even your affinity to the subject matter are \u201cfixed\u201d i.e. you\u2019ve had them forever (or never had them), and that\u2019s just how it is \u2014 you can\u2019t change a thing.\n* **How does this play out in your everyday life?** You say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this because I know I won\u2019t be good at it!\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t do this because it will be painful and hard, and it will take a long time to do, so why try?\u201d\n* **What\u2019s better than a fixed mindset?** Cultivate a growth mindset: show yourself that you can build your strengths and skills through your efforts over time. The benefit: a growth mindset can be hugely empowering during your years of studying. Read Carol Dweck\u2019s book [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/0345472322) to better understand how you can make lasting change with continuous effort.\n\n**\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe Don\u2019t think of studying as an OBLIGATION.**\n\nIf you want to get rid of this problem, it\u2019s important to identify where the sense of obligation is comes from. It can be external or internal.\n\n* **External: Is someone else telling you that you have to study?** It could be a parent, a professor, or a manager. Consider what they\u2019re telling you: do they have your best interests in mind, are they considerate of your future, or do they have another agenda? Use your critical thinking to see if this advice is valuable to you, and if it isn\u2019t, consider other options.\n* **Internal: Are you telling yourself that you have to study?** If you know there is something that\u2019s important for you to do, it\u2019s easier to come up with a solution. All you need to do is make the task less of a chore, and more of an important piece of work \u2014 just *one* piece, not all of it \u2014 that is critical to your personal development. How do you focus on that one piece? Read on.\n\n**\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe Promise yourself you\u2019ll reach ONE STUDY GOAL a day.**\n\nIf you experience resistance towards your studies every single day, the best way to get your mind on board to begin studying is ask yourself this question each morning: \u201cWhat is the **one thing** I am committed to completing today?\u201d\n\n* **There are many benefits to this technique.** It will encourage you to think strategically about the day, keep you focused on your top study goal, make you prioritize what you need to accomplish, and limit the time you\u2019ll actually spend at your desk. It won\u2019t feel infinite any more. Keep in mind this \u2014 identifying your one thing doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have many study goals, but it does means that you can *finish* one today (read a certain number of chapters or practice exam questions, for example), so you can concentrate better on other goals in the days that follow.\n* **It\u2019s easy to implement.** Write the question in big letters on a sheet of paper and hang it on your bedroom or bathroom wall. Pick a location where you can easily see it as soon as you wake up (next to your bed or the bathroom mirror, for example). Then, read it out loud as you start your day. Take a few moments to think what you want to prioritize, and then come up with an answer and say it out loud too. As you go through the day, make sure you\u2019re working on completing your single study goal before you do anything else.\n\nIf you think these tips have helped you, check out my studygram for more : https://www.instagram.com/the.happynerd/",

        "post": "Venting / Realisation\n\nI have some studying to do for an upcoming exam. Had a hard time with it, so I opened up reddit and was trying to find an answer or something to help me study. I stumbled upon a podcast (someone somewhere commented about it) - \"Unfuck your brain\".\n\nWoman on a podcast was talking about what is procrastination, it's connection to anxiety, fears, etc.\n\nAt one moment I just paused the podcast, asked myself two questions (Questions she told listeners to ask themselves): \n\n1. Why am I avoiding this work?\n2. What am I afraid of?\n\nI answered these questions as best as I could and started peeling layers off to get to the root of my so called problem. Then one particular memory was popping in my brain over and over again. Almost made me cry. I just sat there, frozen, remembering it as I'm remembering it now, typing this down.\n\nThe memory was how both of my parents were yelling at me, throwing things around, cursing etc. when I couldn't solve my math homework. I must've been 7-8-9 years old. I remember the feeling, the tears, warm cheeks, ashamed, feeling stupid and useless. Have the same feeling right now. Feeling of being a failure.\n\nI thought of myself as a failure my whole life. Did everything just to be liked by others. Never had my own opinion until couple of years ago (2022- early 2023) but still have a lot of work to do on myself.\n\nI realised my problem with studying and learning began at that time. Now I'm trying to work on that issue and I'm not sure I can do it by myself but I will sure as hell try my best.\n\nMaybe I'm spoiled and maybe everyone went through this but to me it felt like hell and I guess I've never recovered.",

For starters, I am working on something that I have to finish by 8 AM tomorrow and I just started now, at one *fucking* thirty in the morning. Here's what happened: I turn on my laptop at around 8 PM, I open the stuff I need, I realize that I need some files off Facebook, and the next thing you know, bam! TvTropes! YouTube! In fact, I think wouldn't have quit on my binge if not for my mother waking up and giving me a stern dressing down on how much of a procrastinator I am, going on unnecessary  internet binges whenever I have to work on something.  \n\nWhat makes it worse is that I have *known* this for a long time. The one that sticks in my head was last summer, where I qualified for a college's seminar where they have junior high school students get a taste of college. In our (modified) English classes, we were given one week to finish each of three papers. What happened during that week was I would binge on the first four days, then a copy-paste of what just happened tonight, and then it's 3 in the morning and I only have written one paragraph.   \n\nDuring the sermon, my mom snided on what my state will be during *actual* college, and this is where I got scared. I am senior high now, and I have qualified for a full tuition and fees college scholarship in that same college with a high maintaining grade. I'm scared that I won't make the maintaining grade. Hell, I think I'm gonna crash and burn, not only because of procrastination in computer stuff, but also my general procrastination.   \n\nI need to kick this potentially destructive habit guys, and I'll need all the advice I could get from you.

        "title": "Practical guide to beat procrastination and get to studying",
        "post": "**Introduction**\n\nHi everyone, I&#39;m Eric and at the start of my university life I had a lot of problems doing well in school, I was the best procrastinator out there, I just couldn&#39;t start doing things, every time I postponed tasks thinking that the future was a better moment to do them.\n\nI always studied in the last days, not really understanding the material and having hyper-stressful days, with a little hope of passing exams. It was horrible to study all night, I felt anxiety because I didn&#39;t know if all of that &quot;last-minute-crazy-study&quot; was enough to pass the exam, and I beat myself because I never started to study in time.\n\nI failed some exams and barely passed others, I hated myself because I knew I could do better, but I didn&#39;t.\n\nSo I started to read a lot of on how to force myself to do things in time, there were plenty of articles like &quot;10 step to beat procrastination&quot;, &quot;3 steps to get to studying&quot;, etc., but I didn&#39;t know how to implement them in a strategic way.\n\nAfter years of experimenting almost everything, I created a system that really helped me to get out of that hell.\n\nMy brother was in the same shitty situation, and this system helped him too. It gave him a practical guide to implement science-based information in his life and so in his daily actions; he already knew some of them, but he didn&#39;t how to do them in a sustainable and consistent way.\n\nNow we pass exams, without a stressful life, enjoying days and knowing that the future will be a good place to live in.\n\nThanks to the discipline we acquire through this system we now have control on our life.\n\n**Practical Guide**\n\nThose are the questions that gave me the possibility to get out of inaction.\n\nThey force me to make a plan which changes the feelings towards what I have to do, and so my actions in the long term.\n\n1.**WHAT I HAVE TO DO?**\n\nI start writing down a list of challenges I have to overcome, for example, three exams.\n\n2.**AND IF I DON&#39;T KNOW?**\n\nI start to look on the university website, looking for my courses exams.\n\n3.**WICH DEADLINES I HAVE?**\n\nI use the university site to know when I have exams, and I put the date next to the name of the exam.\n\n4.**WHAT I HAVE TO STUDY TO PASS THESE EXAMS?**\n\nI look for materials in:\n\n\n  - Courses links\n  - Ask in university groups (Facebook, WhatsApp, telegram, etc.)\n  - Google\n  - Ask friends\n\nIt always saves me a lot of time knowing what was the best material to study on, in the start I wanted to study everything but I had soon known that is impossible because I didn&#39;t have the time to study everything.\nSo I understood that is really important to put a lot of effort in this part because every minute spent here will save me 10x minutes in the future.\n\n5.**GOOD, KNOW I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO, AND WHAT ARE MY DEADLINES, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS PLAN?**\n\nNow it comes the hard part, at the start I don&#39;t really know how much time will take to study what I have to study, so I understood that the best I can do is this:\n\n\n  a. **Plan time of the day**\n\nI plan the hours in the day for every day of the week, at the start it was really difficult for me to study more than 5 hours, seating on a chair for five hours felt like an eternity, but I got used to it, and the time starts to pass faster and faster.\n\nAfter 1 months I level up at 6 hours, next month 7 hours.\n\n_Don&#39;t be afraid if now every minute feel like an hour, thankfully this perception will change with practice._\n\n_How many hours you can study really depends on a lot of variables, as subjects, sleep, food, parties etc., only you will can know the exact time you can and should study, but if you don&#39;t know now just start with 5, then with time you will know it._\n\n\n  b. **Plan study in the day [MACRO]**\n\nThis is the most difficult part because now I don&#39;t really have information to know how much time it will take me to study these subjects, so I have to estimate, and then realign my plan. It can feel scary, but I find it&#39;s the best way to make a plan when you can&#39;t really plan in the first moment.\n\n**ESTIMATORS** :\n\n- **Lessons (notes, slides etc.)**\n\nThe best option I have is to look at notes (my or other&#39;s notes), and look at:\n\n- **--** Total lessons\n- **--** Materials in each lesson\n- **--** Duration of lesson\n\nNow I can estimate how much it will take me to study a subject:\n\nhours to study this subject = number of total lesson \\* duration of the lesson\n\nIt&#39;s only an estimator, everything varies if I was present in the lesson or if the subject is simple, but this gives me now the possibility to balance work in my week; when I will have more information I will realign the plan.\n\n- **Book or other sources of material**\n\nThat&#39;s another option, I have to take this option when I can&#39;t find anything else, I write down:\n\n- **--** Number of pages\n\nThen I can divide the total number of pages for the days I have to study.\n\nThe number spent on pages can vary a lot, and it always takes time to change the plan. I feel really calm if I&#39;m studying pages rapidly, but I start to be really nervous if some pages take a long time.\n\nIn order to protect me from this effect, I put a 25% of safety time. So:\n\nPages / day = (total number of pages \\*1.25) / days\n\nSafety time always save me from hell, it&#39;s important really to think at this time does not exist, if I don&#39;t do this I start to study slower. 1\n\nIf I can, I use the lesson&#39;s method.\n\n\u00bfWhy this part is so important? It wouldn&#39;t be better to use this time for studying?\n\n&quot; Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the  **axe**.&quot; -  **Abraham Lincoln**\n\nBuild a plan increase the perception of how much it will be possible reach a goal 2, and this influence motivation, so down the line I will not lose minutes or hours because of lack of motivation.\n\nSecond, it creates the awareness of what I have to do and know, and this not only gives a sense of calm, that creates better feelings for studying3 but also creates simpler conditions to say no to other things (for example parties).  When I don&#39;t know what I have to do to get results, it&#39;s easy to say yes to other things. Then what happens?\n\nI feel anxiety when I&#39;m studying and when I am in my free time because I don&#39;t have any control on my life.  When I finally get to study there is no time to do everything and so I fail my exams. The day after I beat myself, I promise that the next time it will be different, but I know that it will be the same horrible situation.\n\nAll of this creates a downward spiral of anxiety and stress.\n\n\n  - **Plan study in the day [MICRO]**\n\nAnd if I wake up late? Or if I have some urgent things to do? What will happen?\n\nFor example, I wake up at 11, when my plan says I have to start studying at 9, my mind starts to visualize every bad future situation possible, the stress level goes up, I start to see my bed as a peaceful place to so come back to sleep, how can I stop this?\n\n**Rescheduling macro**\n\nWhat I know is that the only thing I can do at the moment is to maximize the possibility to get a good grade, so I cut thinking and start re-planning first the macro, I chose what type of combination would be the best and then I start to program the hours of my day using a blank paper.\n\nSo if something does not happen as I had planned I have to the possibility to stay calm because I know that I can re-plan and rethink the day, this stops me from come back to sleep, minimize the stress, and as a consequence maximize grades.\n\n**Plan the day in micro**\n\nI find that I always underestimate the time necessary to do things, now I know I&#39;m not alone 4, I found incredibly helpful plan the entire day, if I don&#39;t have control on every minute of the day I know it will be really difficult to do what I planned, because my mind every time underestimate the time necessary to do daily tasks.\n\nSo I schedule sleeping, eating, friends, sport relaxing, time for change location etc.\n\nThis could sound crazy but I find that a lot of successful people do this5.\n\n\n6.**WHERE**?\n\nIf I can, I always chose a place where there are other people that are studying hard and not procrastinating, I find mathematicians, physicians, and other hard scientists the more disciplined. This is important because it is emotionally easier to study when people around you are not fu\\*\\*ing around.\n\nThe best is to find a library, it is easier to avoid distractions there, and it is more difficult to be distracted.\n\n7.**HOW to REACH MY GOALS, ENJOY THE LIFE AND AVOID BECOMING CRAZY?**\n\nIt takes me a long time to understand what makes a life like this enjoyable and stressful, it is necessary to create conditions that sustained positive feelings and energy in the long term.\n\n**So what influence energy level and feelings?**\n\n8.**SLEEP**\n\nI always know that sleep is important, but I couldn&#39;t sleep enough. When I went to bed I started massively binge-watching on YouTube, or watching films and series or simply whatever gives me the possibility to get out of reality and gives me the possibility to feel better.\n\nThe worst part?\n\nWhen I stop I felt even worse and so I continued doing that until late night.\n\nSo in the morning after was almost impossible to wake up early; when I did it my head was sleepy and tired, and so it was impossible to study.\n\nI find that in order to sleep well it is necessary to create conditions to sleep well, it sounds stupid but it&#39; just a relation of causes and effects.\n\nSo what&#39;s influence sleep?\n\n- **Did I scheduled the time to do what I enjoy or to do nothing?**\n\nI&#39;m human, I need to feel good, that&#39;s it, if I don&#39;t take time to feel good my body will take the time messing my plans.\n\nSo if I acknowledge this situation, I come back to my plan and I reschedule.\n\nBut what if there is no space?\n\n**That&#39;s an indicator that I want to do too many things**\n\nIt was really difficult to accept and realize that I can&#39;t use the whole time of my week, I tried every possible weird solution, but now I know that if I don&#39;t take time to rest, my feelings will give me hard time to do what I&#39;ve planned.\n\nThe book &quot;Essentialism&quot; gave me an understanding of the importance of doing less, but also on how much is difficult to do less 6.\n\n- **Am I tired?**\n\nIf I&#39;m tired what can I do about it?\n\n- **--**** If I wake up late then at night I&#39;ll not be tired, what can I do about it?**\n\nAt the start is really difficult to wake up early, my head easily convinces me that is better to sleep because:\n\n-\n  - **oo** It is too scary to think what I have to do\n  - **oo** I can&#39;t study if sleepy and tired\n\nIt really helped me think that the first day is like an investment for the days after, it doesn&#39;t matter if I&#39;m not super productive today, but it&#39;s really important to be tired this night.\n\n- **--**** Am I doing some physical activity?**\n\nHow can I do some physical activity if I hate the gym, running or whatever is a sport?\n\nThe best solution I find is from nerdsfitness.com 7: jog for three minutes, and then push sprint hard for a minute, repeating this cycle for a certain amount of time (usually around 20 total minutes) , it takes a little time, and I don&#39;t need any subscription to gym or to buy anything.\n\nIt also gives me all benefits of cardio, makes me tired in the night and make me feel good thanks to endorphins that my body release.\n\n9.**FOOD**\n\nI always knew that food is important and that I have to eat vegetables and fruits and blablabla, but how can I start to use food as a fuel?\n\nWithout a comprehension on how food work in my body it was always difficult, the book &quot;Bigger, leaner, stronger 8 gives me an understanding on how food impact on my level of energy, then I use that book to create a &quot;diet&quot; of food I enjoy to eat, that doesn&#39;t cost a lot and that doesn&#39;t take too much time to be prepared.\n\nThe results are astonishing, I&#39;ve never been so full of energy in my life, and it feels really good.\n\nWhat I understood is that I can&#39;t put myself to do hard work with a low-level energy because in the long time I will start to take action in the wrong direction.\n\nThat&#39;s it, I accept it, I stop beating myself, instead I start to exploit how my body works.\n\n10.**FRIENDS, ALCOOL, AND PARTIES**\n\nI wanted to know: can I become successful in university and at the same time enjoy my twenties?\n\nThe answer was yes, not simple but possible, how?\n\n- **Schedule time for parties and for rest in the morning**\n\nI always read about the importance to wake up at the same hour and go to bed early and blablabla, but how can I go to a party, drink and then wake up not too late?\n\n1. I eat a lot before going out\n2. I arrive at the party late\n\n_If I arrive late the time I will pass drinking will be shorter, this is really helpful if the day after I have to study_\n\n1. I drink beer or wine, it easier to drink less, but if I prefer to drink strong drink I chose a ratio 1 alcohol to 3 non-alcohol\n2. I do something, a game or find a girl you like, or I talk with a person on a subject I enjoy or I dance. Having something to do takes my attention away from drinking\n3. If I can, I come back to home walking\n4. I drink a lot of water when you come back home\n5. I eat when you come back home and take a little bit before going to bed\n6. In the morning I take it easy, I take a hot shower, thanks to my scheduled time I know I can rest and not doing anything without concerns\n7. It&#39;s really important to eat to level up my energy\n8. If it&#39;s not late (12.00), I study two hours, eat &quot;lunch hour 15&quot; and then powernap for 30/40 minutes, then study for others three to five hours (17-20 or 17-22)\n9. If its&#39;s late (15:00), I eat lunch, rest for half an hour and then study for 3 to 4 hours\n\n_\\*\\*if you can, wake up at the same time and don&#39;t drink, you will have much more time of fresh mind during the week_\n\n10.**Deal with friends**\n\nI used to have friends that wanted to go out every night, and partying all the time, I understood that I couldn&#39;t. Making plans to reach my goal, give me the possibility to realize how much energy and time I have to put in school, so I started to say no to them.\n\nIt&#39;s not easy because they prefer to have all of their friends at parties, and they put a lot of effort to change your ideas, there was I time where I couldn&#39;t say no, I change this working and thinking about what I want to do in life; this was the most difficult thing I&#39;ve ever did in my life, but it saved me from self-destruction.\n\nA book that really helped me was &quot;The 7\n# th\n habit of Highly Effective People&quot;9, it gave me the possibility to see what it would have happened if I didn&#39;t&#39; change something in my life, this created a need of understanding and learning that changed my thinking, my actions, my results and my feelings towards life.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt&#39;s not easy to change our daily actions and get out inaction and procrastination, but I promise that it will be worth it.\n\nI already walked in the hell you&#39;re in now, and I wish I had someone who could help me get out of there.\n\nIn the next articles:\n\n\u2022 **Food plan for astonishing energy levels!

        "post": "Here is an odd little thing I\u2019ve noticed recently when I procrastinate.\n\nProcrastination starts as an innocent delay. I sit down to start studying but instead of instantly sitting down to study, I give myself permission to do one little thing. \n\nI think, \u201cwell\u2026 checking my Facebook for two minutes won\u2019t hurt. It might just help me relax a little.\u201d As I\u2019m sure you already can guess, that two minute task can turn into 20 minutes pretty quickly. Quickly doing one thing triggers another thought, \u201cwell\u2026 I should do this while I have a minute.\u201d \n\nA half hour (or an hour or two) later I come to realize I still haven\u2019t done any studying. \n\nEventually, I just start.\n\nEveryone probably understands this is a bit of a silly way to work but it\u2019s worse than that.\n\n\n\nGiven the choice to do anything in the world, those things I do to procrastinate aren\u2019t even in the top 100. They\u2019re just quick and pointless tasks. \n\nThe only reason I allow myself to procrastinate with these silly things is that I know they\u2019re not super pleasurable. If instead I thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to go out partying,\u201d my brain would be screaming, \u201cBAD IDEA! You need to study first.\u201d Since I think, \u201cI can stop doing this anytime I want,\u201d I don\u2019t get that same visceral reaction. \n\nYou might notice the real problem with this kind of procrastination now. \n\nI\u2019m not only procrastinating what I need to do. If I were to study immediately, I would have more time after I\u2019m done studying. All that procrastinating time I had doing boring but slightly addictive stuff would have been available after my study session. I would have had more time to hang out with friends or do something that really gives me pleasure instead of wasting it doing half-fun stuff. \n\nOn top of that, stuff is a whole lot more fun when you know you\u2019ve done what you\u2019ve had to do for the day. \n\nWhy waste time having half fun when you can finish and do whatever you want (guilt-free?)\n\nI hope this helps! \n\nHave you ever noticed this in yourself?\n\nTl;dr\n\nTime you spend procrastinating is rarely spent doing what you want to do most of all. It\u2019s usually half-fun stuff. By finishing what you need to do immediately you have more time for guilt-free full fun!",

It is a huge distraction and a means to procrastination . \n\n**Here are some effective ways to stop screentime:**\n\n* Use apps like freedom / forest which helps you to block apps and websites while working or studying.\n* Keep track of your screen time. If you don\u2019t have track then you are not likely to know if you are doing good or bad. My Ipad and Iphone gives a weekly review of screen time and it helps me know in which stuff I have wasted or utilised my time. \n* Put limits to usage of apps . You can easily do that in settings of your phone. Put limitations to social media apps. \n* Put social media apps away from home screen. Keeping it there in-front of you is probably a bad idea. Out of sight is sometimes out of mind. I know it sounds weird but they work!\n* Delete social media apps. You can always browse them through your laptop . Keeping them on your phone is probably not a good idea. This has done wonders for me. I deleted Facebook and I only use it with my browser so that I have the extra friction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps! Best of luck!

(Don\u2019t worry, PC users; the same thing can be done with a program called Freedom.)\n\nBy putting sites on a \u201cblacklist,\u201d you can easily block them for as long as you need.\n\nYou\u2019ll be amazed at how much time you get back.\n\nFurther Reading: [How To Eliminate Distractions And Boost Your Productivity](https://bestproductivitytips.com/how-to-eliminate-distractions/)\n\n## #2: You need to think about how you sleep.\n\nDoes it sound like we\u2019re trying to talk like your mom when we give you this advice? We\u2019re willing to take that chance so you don\u2019t have to waste any of your time.\n\nMany of us spend too much time in bed with our screens on. This is something everyone knows. You have to make sure that happens. I\u2019m ready to take on the responsibility. We all do it.\n\nBut research from Harvard Health shows that the blue light from our screens makes it harder for us to get good sleep.\n\nResearch has shown that this light can help you focus, react faster, and feel better during the day, but it can stop your body from making the sleep hormone melatonin at night, which can throw off your circadian rhythm.\n\nSo, we wake up feeling fuzzy or later than usual, and the quality of our sleep gets worse. Yikes.\n\nThat is, when it\u2019s time to turn off the lights, the blue lights must also go out.\n\nFurther Reading: [10 Powerful Evening Habits For a Better Sleep](https://bestproductivitytips.com/evening-habits-for-a-better-sleep/)\n\n## #3: Get up early and have confidence in the day.\n\nGetting up earlier is a great way to get more done in less time.\n\nThe most obvious benefit of getting up early is that you\u2019ll have a lot more time to do things.\n\nGet up early if you want to get the most out of your day.\n\nResearchers have found that people who get up earlier feel better at the end of the day.\n\nWorking as the sun comes up gives you an advantage over people who are still in bed. It also lets your brain take advantage of the first two and a half hours after you wake up when it is most productive.\n\n\u201cThe early bird gets the worm\u201d is still a popular saying for a reason.\n\nFurther Reading: [6 Reasons To Get Up Early In The Morning](https://bestproductivitytips.com/reasons-to-get-up-early/)\n\n## #4: Don\u2019t try to do too much at the same time.\n\nThe term \u201cmultitasking\u201d comes up a lot when people talk about ways to get more done while spending less time on each task.\n\nPapers and books on the subject have convinced everyone that multitasking is the best way to get ahead in your career and make a difference in the world.\n\nIn recent years, neuroscientific evidence has grown to support the idea that it is physically impossible to do more than one thing at once. As a result, this way of increasing productivity has become less and less popular.\n\nEvidence suggests that switching from one task to another and coming back again in a short amount of time (called \u201cmultitasking\u201d) makes it harder to pay attention and get things done.\n\nFocus on one task at a time and get into a state of flow, where the time goes by quickly and you feel completely absorbed in what you\u2019re doing.\n\nWith the added benefit of being able to focus and work faster, you can get a lot more done in each of your waking hours.\n\nWith this method, you might no longer be able to say that you are too busy.\n\nFurther Reading: [How To Stop Multitasking And Become More Focused](https://bestproductivitytips.com/how-to-stop-multitasking/)\n\n## #5: It\u2019s important to learn how to tell people \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOne of the most important and scary things you can do is to say \u201cno.\u201d You can turn down an idea, a promise, or a request.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to think that saying \u201cno\u201d is rude because there\u2019s always another request, assignment, or project you could take on top of what you already have going on.\n\nBut burnout is a serious and scary mental problem in which people are so stressed out that they start to hate their jobs.\n\nThey might even have physical signs, like feeling tired. Workplace burnout is getting worse all over the world, and it needs to stop.\n\nJust say no.\n\nNo one who cares will mind if you tell them nicely that you\u2019re too busy to do what they want.\n\nTaking care of your mental health is very important.\n\nSo, learn to say \u201cno\u201d to projects you don\u2019t want to do, even if it feels strange the first time, and learn how to keep your work life simple.\n\nFurther Reading: [The Benefits Of Saying No: 9 Reasons Why You Should Say No](https://bestproductivitytips.com/the-benefits-of-saying-no/)",

Even since I started high-school I've always left everything to the last minute, in my final year of High School I never studied until the very last minute, sometimes a few hours before the test, and for the exams I didn't even bother to study for most of them even before the day of the test - this is the level of my laziness. Despite that I managed to achieve a good enough score to get into Chemical Engineering here in Australia (which I believe I don't deserve as I am a piece of lazy piece of shit)\n\nHowever. I'm failing all of my subjects. The issue is not with partying, I don't party at all, and the issue is also not with any work-commitments, as I don't even work. The issue with chronic procrastination and deep laziness. I spend all of my free-time on the internet on Facebook, Reddit and reading blog posts and articles instead of studying and leave everything to the very last minute for assignments and sometimes for exams I don't even bother to study at all.\n\nI just can't seem to do my work, I can't get started and I can't get focused. I have an exam on Monday which I have not studied for and have missed most of the the lectures on. I am positive that I will fail it, and I'm not even bothering to study at the moment because I realize it will be useless since I've already failed it and it will be impossible to catch up on all the missed lectures. I don't want to be like this. I hate it. I hate myself for developing these bad habits all these years.\n\nHowever I don't want to be a piece of shit lazy procrastinator anymore. I've been trying to change everyday for the past four months.. but to no avail. Every day before I go to sleep I say 'Tomorrow is the day I'm going to change' but alas nothing happens. I feel like shit all day because I'm a disappointment to myself and my parents who have been really supportive and caring towards me.\n\nI deserve to fail because it is my fault. I don't deserve to be studying at a university. I may have been smart enough to get into university by doing the absolute bare minimum but that's not fair to all the other people who worked hard and deserved to be in my place but didn't get in. It's a sad fact that people like me who don't put in the effort and who don't want it bad enough are allowed to study.\n\nSo I've decided that I'm going to take a year of from university, get my priorities straight, work for a little while, possibly volunteer and then come back, if I feel I have changed my ways then I will perhaps continue with tertiary study otherwise. But I need advice on whether this is a suitable plan of action. So feedback would be appreciated.\n\nAlso any advice on how I overcome the mess I am in?\n\n\n",

        "title": "I made a free neuroscience app to break bad habits like procrastinating to study",
        "post": "Hey guys. like many people here, I\u2019ve had serious issues when it comes to procrastination\n\nSo, last year, I started a journey to break various bad habits (procrastination, sleeping late, smoking, no soda) following a few promising neuroscience protocols. The data from that social experiment highlighted the importance of finding a \u2018trigger\u2019 and connecting to the network of like-minded people for accountability.\n\nMy issue was sleeping late. The trigger was my phone and YouTube. To solve this trigger, I moved the power outlet, charger, and phone to the living room and turned it off before going to bed. This decision was \u201csuper effective\u201d.\n\nA few of my friends got on board to tackle addictions like smoking and drinking, which were somewhat successful. But the one case I remember strongly was a friend that couldn\u2019t study on time. He just couldn\u2019t sit down and open a book before watching YouTube after work. With his desperation and a call for help, we decided to work together. After some soul searching, we found out that his **trigger** was simple as a browser homepage. Guess what page his browser first showed?\n\n**YouTube** (duh)\n\nAfter a little debate, we changed his home page to one of his online courses and promised to spend just 5 minutes on that page before leaving. So everyday, at 6 pm after work, I checked up on him by Zoom to see if he kept the commitment. In about a week, he was able to study 30 min \\~ 1 hour per day.\n\nApparently, this was his first time studying consistently, everyday.\n\nThis trigger protocol worked great, but it seemed extremely difficult to help hundreds of strangers through personal checkups and/or YouTube videos. That\u2019s why, as some of you already know, I teamed up with a group of scientists and developers to make a useful tool. Our plan was to create a neuroscience-based habit platform where you can find like-minded people and solutions and apply scientific protocols to break bad habits.\n\nWe released an early version and got some feedback. The app had many holes and many features were lacking. But the data was in. With our users\u2019 help, the devs were able to launch an official version a few weeks ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s new/upgraded** (\\*but not limited to):\n\n* 3 main neuroscience protocols embedded into the app\n   * [RAS](https://medium.com/desk-of-van-schneider/if-you-want-it-you-might-get-it-the-reticular-activating-system-explained-761b6ac14e53)\n   * [Habit loop](https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/)\n      * [How rewards stimulates a specific part of the brain in half a second](https://neurosciencenews.com/habits-brain-15805/)\n   * Social win and accountability\n* A fresh tutorial\n* Triggers and real-life solutions\n* Feed system to see others\u2019 triggers and solutions\n* Accountability through matching patterns\n* A bad habit category to choose from\n* More reward for daily and weekly engagements\n* Free brain hacks every week or two via email\n* Improved user experience and interface\n* Faster performance\n* Smarter push notifications\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Future plans**\n\n* Tinder for habit (Find your habit match \ud83d\ude18)\n* Group challenges to participate and win\n* 1 on 1 with behavioral scientists & neuroscientists\n* Monetary compensation for helping others\n* More types of data (voice memos, gifs, videos)\n* Blockchain\n* And more...\n\nUnfortunately, an\u00a0**Android**\u00a0version isn\u2019t available(yet).

        "post": "Hi guys, I'm a doctor, and I'm here to share tips for studying more efficiently and being more productive. I'll write here on Reddit and Twitter (link in bio).\n\nThe difficulty to stay productive and study efficiently during a school/college year is because we have to juggle between two extremes:\n\n\\- Giving ourselves too little time (procrastinating)\n\n\\- Giving ourselves too much time (getting hit by Parkinson's Law)\n\nProcrastinating means postponing tasks. It can be driven by various factors, such as feeling overwhelmed, lacking motivation, or not knowing where to start.\n\nParkinson's Law claims that work expands to fill the time available for completion. So if you give yourself too much time to study a topic, the work will expand to fill the time we allocated.\n\nTo avoid both, follow these three simple steps:\n\n1. Create fake deadlines\n\nThis helps you create a sense of urgency to get you into productivity mode. Giving yourself too much time ends up in an unnecessary overcomplication of the task you must complete.\n\n2. Use the Pomodoro Technique\n\nSet a timer of 25 minutes and focus on a single task during this period. If the task you have to perform is too big, break it down into smaller chunks and focus on just one chunk during your Pomodoro session. The 25 minutes is, of course, an indicative time; more complex tasks will require longer times but don't try to focus for more than 1 hour straight as your ability to concentrate drastically declines after this time.\n\n3. Avoid perfectionism\n\nPerfectionism is dangerous as it can cause you to procrastinate or give too much time to complete a task. Focus on getting 80% perfection; this is more than enough in most cases. Throughout med school, I understood that it's not worth remembering everything (it's also impossible); if you know 80% of every topic, you'll be one of the best students in your class.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Create fake deadlines\n2. Use the Pomodoro technique\n3. Avoid perfectionism",

        "post": "Because it looks we will have to stay home for a while, I want to share this with you:\n\nI study or work from home regularly and I found out how this can soon turn into 2 different kinds of hells:\n\n## The procrastination hell\n\nWe get into this kind of hell when we do nothing - we start to procrastinate and get into\u00a0the vicious cycle of procrastination.\n\nTrust me, you don\u2019t want to slip into this vicious cycle because you start hating yourself, get disgusted and your well-being deteriorates. Later, your confidence suffers, you start feeling helpless which can lead to depression.\n\n## The workaholic hell\n\nThe second one happens when we start studying or working (both terms here are interchangeable) all the time. We wake up, we start studying and end before we go to bed or sometimes we even go to bed later.\n\nIt\u2019s because we spend the whole day in the same room and we lose sense between work and leisure. This sounds productive. But it\u2019s often not sustainable and when we\u2019re deprived of fun/leisure for too long, we start to dread work, which seems like a giant mountain of drudgery always looming ahead of us. It doesn\u2019t take long and we start to procrastinate. Then we usually slip into the first hell of procrastination.\n\nIn both hells, you can also start experiencing social isolation which if you\u2019re not used to being alone can make you go crazy pretty quickly.\n\nTherefore, to stay productive and sane, it\u2019s important to give when staying at home a thought and create a daily rhythm.\n\nThis is what years of this taught me:\n\n## The most important steps to keep you sane\n\n## 1. Plan when your workday begins and when it ends\n\nThis protects you from both kinds of hells.\n\nLet\u2019s say you decide to study from 9 AM to 12:30 PM and then from 1 PM until 5:00 PM. Why create an explicit schedule like this?\n\n1. It prevents you from working until the evening\n2. When you have limited time, you use it better and you stick to a regime. Without a clear daily rhythm, you can spend your morning reading Reddit or watching Youtube thinking you can catch up later. This leads to being behind and then procrastinating more.\n3. Having a clear regime also saves you from perfectionism because you have to have something done by the end of your session instead of trying to improve something more and more ad nauseum.\n4. You will ensure your brain that you\u2019re not feeling like your life is just one infinite work slog. We\u2019re scared of doing boring work forever and not having any fun. When your brain knows there is an end to work, it has an easier time to start working.\n\nTry to stick with the plan. If you do, you will get confident in a few days, and then you can adjust it, or play with it however you want or how your schedule allows you.\n\n## 2. Plan your leisure\n\nWhy\u00a0*plan*\u00a0leisure?\n\nWhen we don\u2019t have any ideas for what we\u2019ll do once we\u2019re done with studying, it\u2019s too easy to just fill the time with endless social media scrolling or watching random YouTube videos until 3 AM.\n\nBefore you start studying, plan what you will do after you finish.\n\nRemember:Leisure doesn\u2019t have to be passive staring into screens and passive consumption like watching Netflix, Youtube, Twitch or social media.\n\nWhen you put just a bit of thought into your leisure, you can do some incredibly fun things.\n\nWhen\u2019s the last time you played a board game, or a card game? They are fun and allow you just enough time to chat in between rounds with your friends or family.\n\nBe more mindful about using your leisure time.\n\nHere are some examples what you can do:\n\n* Schedule a call with friends - to keep you from being socially isolated\n* Go to learn something new - you now have the time. What have you always wanted to learn, but never had time for? Juggling? Card throwing? Dancing? Try that!\n* Try out a new recipe - you can take your cooking to the next level, or learn to meal home prep.\n* Read a book. What\u2019s an interesting subject you want to read about?\n* Workout - you probably sit even more than usual when you stay at home. Even if you don\u2019t want to do a full workout, you could just place a yoga mat in the middle of your room to remind you to stretch every time you get up from your desk.\n* Craft something or change your room decor. Could you create a simple poster for your room? Print out a quote? Build a simple coat hanger?\n\nAgain this step will protect you from both the hell of procrastination and the hell of workaholism. When you have scheduled a call at 5 PM you simply can\u2019t keep working. But also if you know, you\u2019re going to call at 5 PM, you can\u2019t waste the first half of the day because then you won\u2019t have time for work.\n\nYou want to build on the principle that leisure is a reward for your work. Plus, leisure can be a time for letting your mind rest or be creative.\n\n## 3. Keep distractions away\n\nOh boy, this is a big one. When you\u2019re at school, you have some external pressures going and other people can probably see what you\u2019re doing.\n\nMost of us want to study, but it\u2019s easy to slip into distractions and mindlessly waste our time. And then we realize how we just wasted the last 3 hours of our life on Reddit/Twitter/Youtube and get disgusted with ourselves.\n\nProcrastination isn\u2019t always about escapism, the internet can be so captivating that we totally lose control of ourselves and don\u2019t even think we\u2019re doing something we shouldn\u2019t. There are the 3 most usual distractions:\n\n1. **Other people and background noise**   \nThis is probably the simplest one:Put on headphones (ideally noise-cancelling) or earphones and keep the noise out by listening to\u00a0[brown noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqzGzwTY-6w)\u00a0or\u00a0[lofi beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnSjnz_mSxk)\u00a0\\- it won\u2019t distract you to focus.\n2. **Phone**  \nYou have to ensure that you won\u2019t be mindlessly opening social media and get sucked in. The simplest rule to follow is to put your phone into another room.\n3. **Personal computer or laptop**  \nIf you\u2019re working on the PC, you have to be savage about blocking distractions. You have to block them deliberately.\n\n## 4. Start when you decided to\n\nThe fourth step to make this work for you is to start when you decided to.\n\nWhen you get into the habit of starting when you said you would, you will get a sense of momentum and you will get much more productive and confident in your ability to accomplish things. And you start to enjoy work.\n\nOn the other hand, if you frequently fail to start when you said you would, your life can fall into pieces quickly because most of us aren\u2019t used to focus at home.\n\nIf that is something you struggle with, we described what to do when you have\u00a0[trouble starting](https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/3-tricks-to-start-working-despite-not-feeling-like-it). Or if you have real issues with procrastination.\n\n## 5. Dress\n\nIt might seem ridiculous, but it really helps. It\u2019s difficult to keep using the daily regime when you stay the whole day in your pajamas. Productivity is connected to how we take care of ourselves.\n\nDon\u2019t stop shaving, don\u2019t stop taking showers.\n\nDo the normal routine as you would do before going to work or to school.\n\nThen ideally, when you stop working you can switch again into your home clothes. This will help you distinguish between your work/leisure time.\n\n## 6. Enjoy your leisure and the time saved by not having to commute\n\nYou want to get into a productive cycle: Get work done \u2192 Build your confidence you can get things done \u2192 get deserved leisure \u2192 get more work done.\n\nThis is, of course, the ideal productivity cycle.\n\nBut most of the people fail in WFH. If you don\u2019t, you can finally enjoy the benefits it offers and what we dream about.\n\n## 7. When you don\u2019t start the day right, don\u2019t give up!\n\nWe\u2019re not perfect. We\u2019re human and probably even you will fail while WFH. That\u2019s a fact. It\u2019s difficult if you\u2019re not used to it.\n\nBut we ask you to not say \u201cwhat the hell\u201d and waste the rest of your day.\u00a0[Instead read this](https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-start-working-after-you-procrastinated-the-whole-day).\n\n# Additional steps\n\nWe know these steps are not possible for everyone but if you have the chance, try them, they will help you immensely.\n\n## 8.Dedicate a single place to studying and nothing else.\n\nWith dressing up and this step, it\u2019s like you went to school, sit in one place, do your work. Then when you finish, you literally leave the school by leaving the place and changing your clothes.\n\nIt sounds simplistic or even dumb, but it helps.\n\nThe more distinguished you can make the spot for studying from your leisure, the better it will be. Having a dedicated spot for studying sends your brain a clear signal:*\u201cI\u2019m here? Okay, now it\u2019s time to focus.\u201d*\n\n## 9. Have 2 different devices - one for studying, the other for leisure\n\nPull out your old laptop, or just use a tablet for your leisure.\n\nOn the work device, you simply bar your access to\u00a0[social media by blocking them](https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/the-best-ways-how-to-reduce-your-internet-use)\u00a0and/or not logging in.\n\nIf you don\u2019t own two devices, instead set up 2 different profiles on your PC.\n\nIf this isn\u2019t possible, use at least 2 different browsers to separate studying and leisure.\n\nThat\u2019s it!\n\nIt\u2019s not that complicated, but it does take some time to figure out what works best for you.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Plan when your workday ends\n2. Plan your leisure\n3. Keep distractions away\n4. Start when you decided to\n5. Dress\n6. Enjoy your leisure and the time saved by not having to commute\n7. When you don\u2019t start the day right, don\u2019t give up!\n8. Dedicate a single place to studying and nothing else (bonus)\n9. Have 2 different devices - one for studying, the other for leisure (bonus)\n\nYou don\u2019t need to do all of those right tomorrow, **but be sure to take action**. Anything is better than just consuming information and not doing anything.\n\nAnd please, if you know about anyone that needs help in this regard, share this.

        "post": "From \"I'll do it later\" to \"I can't start until I have everything perfectly in order,\" procrastination takes many forms. In this post, we'll examine the different types of procrastination and how to overcome them.\n\nHere are five types of procrastination:\n\n1. **Procrastination due to fear of failure**  \nThe fear of not being able to complete a task to the best of your abilities or a fear of failure or rejection can lead to procrastination. To overcome this, remind yourself that failure is an opportunity for growth and is just part of the process. No failure is definitive.\n2. **Procrastination due to lack of motivation**  \nWhen you don't feel motivated to work on a task, it's easy to put it off. Instead of relying on motivation, focus on the process and think like a professional, not an amateur that works only when they feel like it. Have an accountability partner that can help you stay on track.\n3. **Procrastination due to lack of interest**  \nIf you find a task uninteresting, you may be more likely to procrastinate.  \nThe solution is to focus on enjoying the process of improving yourself rather than on the outcome.\n4. **Procrastination due to perfectionism**  \nIf you have high standards for your work and are a perfectionist, you may struggle with procrastination. Remember that perfection isn't achievable and focus on getting 80% correct. To overcome this, learn to celebrate small wins.\n5. **Procrastination due to distractions**  \nIt's easy to get distracted by other tasks or activities, especially in the age of technology. To overcome this, put your phone in airplane mode and use distraction blockers on your computer like Freedom.",

Basically I am doing DE school, in which we are given a set amount of lessons to be done each week. It doesn't matter when during the week we do the lessons it just matters that we get them done. This system is pretty flexible and allows you to do the school work set in whatever way works best for you, whether that be do it all in 1 day, 5 days or 7. Or have a 2 hour break between each lesson, whatever works for you. And you can also contact your teachers online if you get stuck at any point.\n\nIt is now the second week of the holidays and I'm about 5 weeks behind (so half the term) in all my 5 subjects lol, this is because i watch youtube or chat on discord all day. Or when I start doing school work I can only do about 1 lesson before feeling very tired for some reason, which limits my ability to get school work done. And 1 week worth of content is about 20 lessons, with each lesson taking about an hour to do. (Also I'm not entirely sure why the teachers haven't contacted me about this problem, as there are end of lesson quizzes they like you to complete for each lesson so they can monitor how you are going, and i haven't done them in 5 week). SO, I'm not entirely sure what to do, so some recommendations would be great lol!",

        "post": "Tl;Dr at the end \n\nThink about what you're doing when you are procrastinating.\n\nI suspect it's either social media and Netflix or eating or all of these, but yeah everybody knows that, what's special about this? it's the fact that you are finding ways to numb your self and stop thinking above all else. Why? Because if you think, you're likely to stress out.\n\nSo your behaviour is to stop yourself from being overwhelmed and stressed\n\nSo okay procrastinating has to do with stress and anxiety even if it's minor it can trigger procrastination. Is that all? No, lack of clarity and a sense of being overwhelmed also contributes to this. \n\nIf you're starting something big then you're likely to procrastinate since its something that changes how you view yourself. For instance, I\u2019ve been procrastinating on learning photography and posting it online. That\u2019s because I don\u2019t view myself as a photographer (in fact, I view myself as a shit photographer) and thus I\u2019ve been procrastinating on taking photos for longer than I care to admit.\n\nThe nebulous feeling of just not getting started is emotional resistance. Even if it is something exciting that you've been thinking about like the photo series I mentioned earlier, then the more you keep thinking how awesome something will be the more likely you are to procrastinate. I keep thinking how amazing it is going to be and since I can never meet my own unreal expectations (specially as a noob) so I keep on procrastinating. \n\n**What to do about it**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Do something rule**: Everybody can invent a productivity rule right? Here\u2019s mine: Do something, literally anything, seriously, do something. If you\u2019re able to do this constantly, you\u2019ll begin to notice when you procrastinate and why you\u2019re doing it. Even if you don\u2019t do anything about it immediately, noticing goes a long way in minimising procrastination .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Example: Keep your books on your table and call that a win (no, actually do that) open your note taking app and write down the heading and if you do that you\u2019re allowed to get up. \n2. **Actually procrastinate**: i'm not going to say that you stop for ever but if you're able to schedule some time where you can do whatever without expectations that can be helpful. Each day some time to indulge in mindless scrolling, Netflix or whatever you\u2019re into. Since I\u2019ve done this, I don\u2019t procrastinate as much when I\u2019m supposed to be working/studying.\n3. This is where **Stoicism** helped me: The stoics did something called the *evening meditation.* Essentially, you sit and think to yourself what went well in the day, what did you do well and what didn't you do well and how can you improve it. Personally, i like to write this out since having it in front of me is helpful in clarifying what i need to do the next day.\n\nThe conclusion that i've come to is that to minimise the amount of procrastination you need to design your life in such a way that you get constant feedback from your systems to keep focused.\n\nThat\u2019s been my experience with procrastination. Hope that helps.\n\nP.s: Video version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4h_3rMpRrA&t=273s)\n\nTl;Dr: Pay attention to underlying reasons of your procrastination usually: stress, overwhelm, expectations and something that threatens your identity.

        "post": "Lately I make a study plan on what I want to study that day, which is usually 50-75min studying two subjects. But then I procrastinate and just watch Netflix or YouTube. I even haven\u2019t read anything in over a month. Even though I started reading a really great book and I\u2019m over half way through it, but I just don\u2019t want to actually do it. My exam season starts on 10.01.20 and I should start studying soon. Cause I\u2019m going to write 5-6 exams and I could have done more, but will just do the others next semester. I was sick last semester and that\u2019s why I need to do them now. Also I always use the app forest, which really helps. But my problem is that I don\u2019t want to study in the first place. I haven\u2019t gone to my nearby uni library since July, even though it only takes 15 min to go and it\u2019s really nice there. I mean it has great lighting, ok wifi, a cafeteria and enough places to sit and it\u2019s kinda really pretty. Luckily I have over a month to study, but need help to actually do it.",

        "post": "It's finals season, lock in and study hard. But wait, do you feel stressed and procrastinate and end up in an anxious unproductive cycle?  A way to eliminate that is to go through that and learn from it. Not everyone wins all the time. There are times when the pressure will make you crumble/feel defeated. That's not the end of things. Take those feelings and learn why you felt them. Some possible reasons include: \n\n1) Not starting work sooner, the anxiety due to procrastination may \"freeze\" some people. They instead \"doom scroll\",  binge their favourite show, smoke, drink, and/or do anything to distract them from the anxiety. All of these things can be done after finals are over. But, you have to make up for lost time and focus. \n\n2) Poor planning/approach to assignments/exams and studying leaves anyone lost and stressed. Taking some time to think ahead and understand how you learn/write best is key. There are a ton of videos online that can help you identify how you learn best.  E.g., I learn/study best by reading and writing. \n\n3) Distractions not being addressed. Turn that phone, PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Netflix, YouTube off! Even Reddit is a distraction (I'm the one on here writing this HA)! My phone is the biggest distraction. I turn it off and put it in another room. Out of sight, out of mind. DND isn't enough for some, and that's okay. The same applies to all distractions. \n\nI hope this post reaches people and helps! I'm graduating in 2 weeks and have two papers, an assignment, a quiz, and a final exam to study for. All the years I spent learning and making mistakes have allowed me to write and share this post.  Nobody's academic journey is perfect, the road is long and unclear. Your vehicle to navigate this road is your study habits and mindset toward completing coursework. Modify that vehicle for better performance by improving your habits and thinking. It's like adding a turbo or a cold air intake to a nice V8 LOL!! You'll have more fun down that road and in style too.\n\nI wish everyone the best of luck and hope they kill it this finals season! \n\n&#x200B;",

        "post": "So I am at university now and have this one assignment I had to finish.\n\nI took a skim through it when it was released and I did give it a start around the first day.\n\nI had the impression that it is very easy, but while easy it is very complicated and can take a lot of time being careful with the numbers and formulae.\n\nI had been procrastinating this assignment, watching Youtube and Netflix shows, and doing gaming for a few days.\n\nIn the later part of the procrastination, I had been shouting to myself I wanted to stop and I wanted to get out of it but I simply couldn't. It was very painful and I knew I would be doomed to fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI barely had anytime left, and I had to rush through the assignment in less than a day. In the end I couldn't finish 2 questions out of 12ish and I know 1 is wrong but I didn't time to search for documentation and experiment on how to get the required form, but it's nothing rocket science, really just something troublesome and time-consuming but easy conceptually.\n\nThe uni is extremely competitive, I would lag seriously behind for this because the assignment is so easy that everyone would get close to full marks. And leaving a few questions blank would give the marker a very bad impression that might affect my other questions I feel.\n\nI was given very ample time to finish the assignment, but I always tend to drag it till the end and force myself into completing with just enough or slightly insufficient time. I feel really angry at myself for constantly putting myself into this. It is an excruciating process too. The stress is unimaginably big. In the end I had to cut loss and just submit an incomplete version, knowing I would fail miserably. The overall marks I would estimate to be around 60 conservatively speaking, depending on how they allocate the weights, when everyone would be 95+. Unfortunately it isn't a course in which an exam is worth 80% overall and coursework only 20%. Rather, the exam is worth 60% and coursework+midterm worth 40%. It may not be as big of an issue in absolute terms but in relative terms when the rest of the class are very competitive and near-perfect disciplined humans, getting even 80 in one assignment I would feel is a huge detriment and if they strictly rank students to allocate grades in the end, I could end up at best a B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to get multiple As, and back then I would finish the assignments very early. Later on in my study I occasionally end up in situations like this too. I always have been telling myself to start early, but it wasn't always possible and procrastination would strike.\n\nThe last assignment of this course I also completed fairly early, but this one I just failed myself and forced myself into this tight timeframe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have watched numerous procrastination videos and read many self success books e.g. Atomic Habit, The Power of Habit, etc. over the years. I have never fully defeated procrastination and I often still end up being a deadline fighter. It is easy to understand the theories, but not so much when applying in a practical sense. I do many things like starting 5 mins first, try not to use willpower but to just treat studying as part of a habit like brushing teeth, the Pomodoro method, etc.. These do help to tackle a more general and regular type of procrastination, but the problem is once I fall on one procrastination, it is very very difficult to pull myself out. I would not have the conscious power to control myself to apply those methods/techniques as I would be completely immersed into the activity I am indulging in.\n\nAnd this type of procrastination is not a chronic or regular one, but rather a bursty one with not so predictable occurrence. High stress may or may not trigger it out, even low stress like in this case me being given ample time and I feel like I have a whole week of free time, I can still end up falling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe pain I suffer from rushing this assignment is so immense that I kinda want to say \"Screw this, it's not worth me enduring the pain just for this little grade. It is humiliating and I do not think I would perform any worse than any student if I properly prepare for things\". I simply do not think I deserve this pain. Yes I did procrastinate and didn't manage my time well, but these are more like blunders. Yet in my uni environment, a blunder or a careless mistake in managing my time would cause severe consequences. Suffering from such huge stress and pain just because of one blunder? (One procrastination fall would end up sucking up days from me) Having to always and consistently stay in control of myself and be \"disciplined\"? I just can't and I have been struggling to change for many years and still to no avail. I just don't think it's worth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe pain is also from the fact that I did spend a lot of time and effort on the course, reading hard mathematical textbooks (the theories behind are hard, but this assignment is very application focused and thus easy), paying attention and answering questions in class and talking to the professor. All for nothing, all my effort gone because of one procrastination blunder. It is very very frustrating to see you destroy something you build so hard. This has happened a lot before, and perhaps I have been subconsciously relishing this process of destroying something I built and the pain and sadness might make me feel more alive and existent that I subconsciously lead myself back into this fall over and over. Based on this hypothesis, I also told myself not to feel sad about it (it's hard not to, and the sadness is immense) in order to not reinforce any potential subconsciously relishing of this fall. The world and life is so much more than just this course, it's totally not worth feeling sad about such tiny thing. I also tell myself I have other courses and even if I get a C, if I can still get As in the rest it's still not too bad and I should adjust my mind to tackle the other courses and not let the sadness and frustration from this course affect too much of my other courses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still attempting to climb back up and adjusting my emotion for the life ahead.\n\nClimbing back up isn't the biggest problem, but the fact that I have had to climb up so often from such falls. Each time I face this kind of situation, I get more frustration. It has been telling me the past methods have failed, but I have experimented with many methods and I kinda feel it's not something that can be fundamentally fixed by methods or techniques.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any advice!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just found out I got full score in the previous assignment of the same course, and it was considerably harder than the one I failed to finish. It just makes me feel worse knowing I failed to complete such a trivial piece of work due to poor time management. But I ain't giving up, I'll try to ace in the midterm to show at least I have the capability to solve all these problems even if I end up doing poorly in one assignment",

        "post": "# How to start working after you procrastinated the whole day\n\n*\u201cI\u2019ve been procrastinating the whole day.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything today, I\u2019m such a loser.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cNothing done, again. Why do I always end up watching YouTube videos?\u201d*\n\nAll of us have experienced a day when we\u2019re surfing the internet the whole day instead of doing something productive.\n\nLet\u2019s say it\u2019s already late afternoon,\u00a0**what are you going to do?**\n\nMost of us, if there isn\u2019t any scary deadline looming close,\u00a0**say \u201cwhat the hell, might as well continue\u201d** **and waste the rest of the day.**\n\nIt\u2019s called the\u00a0**What The Hell effect**.\n\nThe best example of it is when people diet.\n\nThey eat healthy for some time, but then they slip. They eat a donut or drink soda.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d and then they go on binge eating streak.\n\nThis is binary thinking - 0 or 1. I was eating healthy (at 1), but then I failed by eating something unhealthy, I\u2019m at 0 and whatever I do now doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nBut it does matter. After the binge is over, regret and low self-esteem flood in.\n\nAnd it works the same with productivity. I haven\u2019t done anything yet, therefore I\u2019m 0, I\u2019m a loser. You can also hear: I don\u2019t have enough time to do something now or I\u2019m already tired. Might as well finish that TV series.\n\n**Why do we let ourselves get away with doing this?**\n\nBecause\u00a0**we love resets**: starting tomorrow, starting next week or starting on the New Year.\n\nAll these resets have something in common. They\u2019re in the future and we naively think this time it\u2019ll be different.\n\nCan it work? Kind of. Some people can really change their lives by resetting. But simply remember how gyms are full at the beginning of January and how soon they empty out.\n\nAlso, this concept of reset has still the same glitch.\u00a0**The Binary Thinking**. When you don\u2019t go to the gym once, you failed, you\u2019re a loser now, again.\n\n**Because resets fail most of the time, we shouldn\u2019t bet on them.**\n\nWhat to do instead?\n\n## Mindset Shift #1: Dump the Binary Thinking\n\nIt is possible to be at 1 or 0 but in most cases, it isn\u2019t worth it.\u00a0**We don\u2019t have to be perfect in our diet, productivity or life in general to move forward**.\n\n**When you eat a cookie, you aren\u2019t at 0.**\n\nIf you count that you eat 5 times per day that makes it 35 meals per week. You failed once out of 35 tries.\u00a0**That puts you at 0.97**. And you don\u2019t have to be 1 to be healthy anyway.\n\nIf you work 40 hours per week and you procrastinated the last 5 of them, you can still be at 0.875. You don\u2019t have to be productive every single waking hour anyway. Quality over quantity is what counts.\n\nAll of us fail once in a while and it\u2019s fine. It\u2018is human.\n\nThat also leads to...\n\n## Mindset Shift #2: You don\u2019t have to say What the Hell\n\nWhenever you realize that you\u2019re off track, you don\u2019t have to say what the hell.\n\nInstead,\u00a0**think about who was the one who wanted this goal**. It was\u00a0*you*.\n\nDo you still want it? If so, then acknowledge you failed a little bit.\u00a0**But if you want, you can still hit the target as closely as possible.**\u00a0To be 0.93 is better than 0. Even 0.5 is way better than 0.\n\nThat\u2019s it. It is such a small thing, but it can be life-changing. It works as a nice relief.\n\nWhat if you really don\u2019t want the goal? Then it is fine. All of us have some fake goals that are just wishes or dreams that we don\u2019t really want and we\u2019re faking it because of some internal or external pressures.\n\nWhen you realize something is a fake goal, please don\u2019t feel guilty about not pursuing it. Instead, find a goal you feel more motivated to pursue.\n\nOkay, now you have the correct mindset.\n\n## Let\u2019s finally get to work.\n\nIf you were surfing the internet all day, you\u2019ll notice that your mind is restless. You can\u2019t focus properly. You might want to quit immediately.\n\nThere are 2 possible ways how to solve it (combine them for the best results):\n\n## 1. Calm down\n\nThe best one to calm yourself down is to sit down on the chair for 5 minutes, turn off the screens, and just stare at the wall or close your eyes.\n\nBreathe. Take deep breaths. Or focus on your inhaling and exhaling.\n\nGet bored.\n\nOur brains are usually full of dopamine hits from the internet and we\u2019re overwhelmed. You know that feeling.\n\n## 2. Do the bare minimum\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to start because we\u2019re scared that it\u2019s the end of fun. Or you might be scared by the sheer amount of work or scale of the project ahead of you.\n\nThen make it less difficult or less scary:\n\nSet up a timer for 5 or 15 minutes and do a quick outline.\n\nTake a paper and a pencil and sketch out the first draft. Get the first quick and dirty version. Get from 0 to 0.1.\n\nOnce you\u2019re working, you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s easier to keep working then it was to start working. When you get into the work, you will become curious about the problems it entails and you can even start enjoying the work you\u2019re doing. You can get into the flow.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nWhen you realize you\u2019re failing to achieve your goal:\n\n**Shift your mindset**\n\n1. Realize it\u2019s not binary, you don\u2019t have to get to 1 (100%), 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 are all good.\n2. Don\u2019t say \u201cWhat the Hell,\u201d instead reflect on why you the goal is worth the effort for you\n\n**Take action**\n\n1. Take a step back and calm down. Let the restlessness go away.\n2. Start with the bare minimum. Do 5 minutes of work. Create a rough outline. Write the first paragraph.\n\nEven if your day didn\u2019t go according to your imagination (didn\u2019t get to 100%), it doesn\u2019t mean it has to end at 0% satisfaction and 100% regret.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope it helps. I heard about What The Hell effect a few months ago and I was trying to figure out how to stop screwing myself.",

Afterwards, you will find yourself preparing for the test or other classes just the day before. So, if you don\u2019t know how to stop procrastinating, check out these tips:\n\n*  *Buy yourself a planner. The first advice on how to overcome procrastination is to keep a planner.* \n*  *Set priorities. If you want to stop procrastinating, then you should definitely learn how to prioritize.* \n*  *Do not be glued to the screen. Whether it is a tablet, a laptop or a smartphone that is always with you, it should not distract you from the most important daily tasks and goals.* \n* *Create a perfect working atmosphere. If you like working or studying in comfort, having a cup of warm tea/coffee/cocoa and a cozy blanket nearby, then why not? It\u2019s perfectly OK unless it makes you fall asleep.* ",

It being Youtube, Quora and Reddit(thankfully I do not and probably will never have Insta, BeReal etc)\n\nescapism: In the uncomfortable truths category I have noticed that whenever I am faced with difficult issues I try to run away or escape to various addictions. Whenever hard things have to be done instead of taking action to make them easier I procrastinate and fantasize about the future. (I feel like I am doing the same with the above-mentioned exam)\n\nI'd also like to talk to a therapist at some point but that is an awkward conversation I'm not ready to have with my parents yet.\n\nTL/DR: Parents will not enroll me in competitive exam if I do not study more in the next 3 months.

On the day of the presentation I was shaking from hunger, anxiety, and sleep deprivation, and by the end of it all I was essentially knocked out for 2 days. The good news was I became the number 1 student for that class and the project I made for it is being showcased in a national convention.\n\nBut this led me to neglecting my other subjects and while I passed most, I ended up failing one. What was worse I was doing so well in that Subject, practically aced every test and excercise til the end when I ended up failing the Final Project.  My professor even told me it felt like I prioritized another subject more and he was right.\n\nMy parents were disappointed in me, especially since I did so well the term before, and I promised to do better this term.\n\nBut I didn't, I started well then as the term went on I just became more and more demotivated and ended up procrastinating more than last term and ended up missing more projects. Though this time I have little excuse \n\nIt's now almost the end of the term I'm in danger of failing the same class. I emailed my professor if there was any extra credit I can do, he hasn't answered but that's legit my last hope.\n\nEverytime I go to do my homework and studies I get weirdly anxious for some reason, and that makes me procrastinate more which makes more anxious the next time.

        "post": "Hello, as a procrastination/anxiety coach, I see a large difference in between students that can get admission, and prosper in Ivy League schools(e.g.Harvard, Yale, Stanford).\n\nMany think it's due to innate talent; however, they practice better study habits, that help them deal with procrastination. Poor procrastination and study habits increases stress, and affects sleep which make it much more difficult for students to retain information.\n\nThe key rule when Ivy league college students study school material and deal with procrastination; they focus on breaking down a task.This can be done using the 5 Step Process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Intro:\n\nThey do not know how to make a task easier for themselves. Today, I am presenting you with the 5 Step Process to break down any task.\n\n**Wanna skim through?** Key points are bolded and in point form. I hope this helps.\n\n# The 5 Step Procrastination Process\n\n1.) Initial Setup: Planning\n\n2.) Beginning\n\n3.) Objective\n\n4.) Follow-Through/Execution\n\n5.) End Goal\n\n## Initial Setup\n\nThe initial setup includes the tools needed to get the job done. Don\u2019t think too hard.\n\nThis could be as simple as\n\n* Quiet room\n* Laptop\n* Charger\n\nTry to keep tools in close proximity.\n\nGoing back and forth between steps slows momentum and wastes time. Especially the initial setup.\n\nSort of like going to the gym, taking your pre-workout, and then realizing that you forgot your shorts, then needing to go back home. (sigh)\n\nSounds super\u00a0simple right? That\u2019s because it is. No matter how anxious you are, the setup is supposed to be easy. The most important step is starting.\n\nAfter writing down all the resources you need to complete a task, your anxiety regarding the task will begin to decrease. Knowing you have the tools needed gives you the confidence to lean on.\n\n## Beginning:\n\nNow that the initial setup is done. The next steps:\n\nThe beginning is putting yourself in the right direction. Starting a task is difficult when you skip the planning stage.\n\nTo stop getting stuck at the beginning. **Change your mindset from: \u201cHow can I do this?\u201d To, \u201cwhat do I need to know, to be able to do this.\u201d**\n\nFiguring out what questions you\u2019re answering and/or what topics/actions you need to learn before continuing.\n\nDoing a sales pitch to a client? The beginning would be finding out the product you\u2019re selling. The things you need to know about the product. The company/demographic you are selling to.\n\nThe beginning is usually the quickest process, unless the initial setup is longer, then the beginning becomes relatively quick.\n\nSee the beginning, as choosing a brochure, and the next step(objective) as choosing where things go.\n\n\\*\\*Stuck on this step?\\*\\*The quickest solution is to ask.\n\n**Who do I ask?**\n\nThis could be an online forum, your boss, client, colleague. People appreciate a person who asks, vs going in the wrong direction and wasting time and/or money.\n\n**How do I ask?**\n\nThe best way to ask is being specific.\n\n**\\[ 1 Sentence on What you need help with?\\]**\n\n\\-Important, because it saves time if the person can\u2019t right off the bat.\n\n## Asking for help template:\n\n**Step 1: \\[What are you trying to do?\\]**\n\n**Step 2: \\[Part you are stuck on?\\]**\n\n**Step 3: \\[Say what you\u2019ve done\\]**\n\nThese 2 examples featuring Bill and John is a quick reason why the first step, \u201c\\[What are you trying to do?\\]\u201d is so helpful\n\nIt saves time and frustration for both parties.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n**Bill:** I need help moving\n\nJohn: Sure, what time do you want me there, and how long?\n\nBill: umm what time works well for you?\n\nJohn: blah blah blah\n\n**\\*20 minutes into conversation\\***\n\n**Bill:** Yeah, the main reason I called you for help moving, is that I need to use your pick-up truck\n\n**John:** Oh, well I sold it. A week ago.\n\n**Bill:** Oh, well thanks anyways. I guess I\u2019ll just rent a truck then.\n\n**Example 2**\n\n**Bill:** Hey man, Could I borrow your pickup truck to help me move?\n\n**John:** No can do, sold it a week ago.\n\n**Lesson Example:**\n\nThat\u2019s why the first step is important. Giving a brief one sentence explanation on the problem and/or the desired solution: saves time, and less annoying\n\n## Asking for help examples\n\n## Example 1 Good:\n\nIntroduction: Working as an office assistant\n\n**Step 1: \\[What are you trying to do?\\]**\n\n**Employee:** I\u2019m having trouble sending emails\n\n**Boss:** What\u2019s up?\n\n**Step 2: \\[Part you are stuck on?\\]**\n\n**Employee: I\u2019m trying to send an email to \u201cWorker101\u201d.** When I hit send it says email not found in the directory.\n\n**Step 3: \\[Say what you\u2019ve done\\]**\n\n* I tried restarting\n* I turned off the firewall\n* I configured the server settings\n\n**Boss:** Text me the email you\u2019re sending it to\n\n**Employee: \u201c**[**Typo@dumy.com**](mailto:Typo@dumy.com)**\u201d**\n\n**Boss:** I see your problem. It\u2019s actually, \u201c[Typo@dummy.com](mailto:Typo@dummy.com)\u201d You forgot to put 1 \"m\" instead of 2.\n\n## Example 2 Bad:\n\n**Employee** My emails not working?\n\n**Boss:** What\u2019s up?\n\n**Employee**: I can\u2019t use it\n\n**Boss:** Can you login to your account?\n\n**Employee:** Yes?\n\n**Boss:** Alright, let me send you an email\n\n**Boss:** Did you get it?\n\n**Employee:** yes?\n\n**Boss:** Is your email is working now?\n\n**Employee:** No, I can\u2019t send emails\n\n**Boss:** Have you tried restarting it?\n\n**Employee:** yes\n\n**Boss:** Have you looked at the server settings?\n\n**Employee:** yes\n\n**Boss:** Do you get an error message\n\n**Employee:** Yeah, it says: email not found in the directory.\n\n**Boss:** Text me the email you\u2019re trying to send too\n\n**Employee:**\n\n**Boss:** Oh, there\u2019s a typo it\u2019s supposed to be \u201c.com\u201d instead of \u201c.ca\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve all met an example 2\n\n**What if I haven\u2019t met an example 2?**\n\nThen you are example 2. Just kidding.\n\nBut seriously, asking questions and showing that you at least tried to solve the problem, goes a long way. Which both examples have done?\n\nHowever, the employee from example 2 makes the boss work too hard to give the boss/IT support to find the problem.\n\nThe person(employee) asking for help, is responsible for explaining the problem as clearly as possible.\n\nThe Boss(helper) is responsible for giving a clear solution.\n\n## Objectives\n\nRealize how this article is broken into headings? Then each heading is broken down into subheadings?\n\nIf this was one huge block of text it would be impossible to skim through. This method helps the author the most(me).\n\n**I write the Headings first, then the subheadings, then the example scenarios (What my example will be about). This helps me to write much faster.**\n\nEach heading, subheading, example scenario is an objective.\n\nThe tasks/steps are filling them up with words that fall under the category. Take this heading for example \u201cObjective\u201d. The objective of this subheading is to explain how to work through objectives.\n\n## Follow-Through/Execution\n\nCongratulations, We\u2019re at the follow through. At this point, you should have a solid understanding of what to do next.\n\n**\\*If you do not know what you\u2019re doing, then break down the objectives into even smaller tasks, or take a larger task and turn that into an objective\\***\n\nThis is where you make the most visible progress. Follow-Through requires\n\n## Concentration\n\nYou can finish the previous steps (Initial setup, beginning, concentration etc.) Then take a break.\n\nThe follow-through is given this name for a reason. Any hesitation can set you back, leaving you confused.\n\nFollow-through is why math teachers always say, never stop in the middle of an equation, and English teachers say, never stop in the middle of a sentence/paragraph.\n\nOnce you leave and come back, you\u2019ll feel confused and/or disoriented and forget the plan you had in mind.\n\n**Take your breaks at the end of an objective, not during.**\n\nNot possible? Then wait until you at least complete the task you are doing.\n\nHas this ever happened to you? Coming back to a checkpoint, for a game you have not played in a while. Then realizing you have no idea where to go? Or what to do?\n\n## How do I Stop Losing Focus?\n\nI know this isn\u2019t an AA meeting; The first step to stay concentrated is **admitting you have a problem.**\n\n**Track down where most of your time is wasted.** Some, smoke weed, others play video games or watch sports.**Keep your addictions out of the house**. Because these are your weaknesses. Get carried away with smoking too much weed. Make it a rule that you will not bring weed in your house.\n\nThe same way the greats did. Destroy and remove all distractions.\n\nCharles Darwin: responsible for the key concepts of evolution; was known for his ability to make groundbreaking discoveries and projects in a short period of time.\n\nHow? He would lock himself in his room for long hours, with no distractions. That\u2019s what you need to do.\n\nWhen it is time to study, at least **zero distractions should be in the same room as you.**\n\n**Imagine how much work you\u2019d accomplish if you left your phone at home before going to the library.**\n\nYour study area should be free of distractions. No phone, no video games etc. If you\u2019re not using the internet for something productive, turn it off.\n\n**tl;dr Before completing a task Write down:**\n\n**The materials/resources needed:** Laptop, pencil, headphones\n\n**What you're going to be learning:** Calculus, auto formatting excel documents\n\n**Where you're going to learn it.** Khan Academy\n\n**Play the objective:** Plan/write what the task looks like when completed.\n\n**What the first step is**\n\n**Always Follow Through:** Don't switch between assignments\n\n**End Goal:** When all your objectives complete, hand in the work. Time perfecting, takes away from completing other tasks\n\nIf you have any of your own tips about procrastinating meet me in the comments.\n\nP.S.\n\nIf you liked this, feel free to check out the rest of my [procrastination guide.](https://wordpress.com/post/stephantoure.com/51) Free of course!",

        "post": "I believe that ambiguity is the enemy of procrastination, and reducing ambiguity can help reduce procrastination. I've noticed that tasks that are unclear or too broad often lead to procrastination because our brains become uncomfortable with the uncertainty of what exactly needs to be done. For example, saying \"finish my English essay\" is not specific enough and can lead to procrastination.\n\nIn addition, overwhelming feelings about large and complex tasks can also contribute to procrastination. I've found that breaking down the task into small, manageable steps can help. For instance, writing an essay can be broken down to opening the document and writing just one sentence.\n\nHowever, it's important not to fall into the trap of overplanning as a form of procrastination. While planning is helpful, if it keeps us from taking action, it's just another way of putting off the task. Therefore, I limit my planning to just one or two specific steps to get started.\n\nWhen I find myself procrastinating something, I try to make it small enough that I can cross the \"starting threshold.\" If I can't get started, it means the task is still too big. For example, to start an assignment, I make my goal to simply create the document and write three words.  \n\n\nI hope this helps!",

(Despite being hardworking, if u'r scoring avg, there're issues with the direction of your efforts).\n\nIf you keep feeling miserable before few days of test/exam, & you keep feeling that the biggest barrier is to just get started, here's something which is really effective.\n\n    Find a question paper covering topics of your test, try \"\"solving\"\" it.\n\n>Try solving all the ques. Mark ques which u don't understand. Then cross check your answers. Now whichever ques you got wrong, open you books. Find out the solution. With good understanding of it.\n\nThis way, it will get you started. (For intermediate pupils) It'll spotlight on topics you need to work on.\n\nThis really helped me initiating and I thought to share it with y'all.\n\n####P.S.: (not the main topic of post tho)\n\n* never argue with your parents when they're advising something \"just for you\".\n\nIt's not like 'not arguing' means 'not arguing at all'. Like even if they're asking to stop studying and doing some other work which isn't important, and if you won't utter anything, it won't work like that. you gotta speak up there. But when they're saying that \"do this to get better at studying\" \"try giving your exam this way to get good scores\" \"get at dinner table on the time\" etc like things, don't argue like \"u don't even know how tough studies are or how to study\" and such thing. Hear 'em. If they're right, accept it(the advice). If they're wrong(not most likely), just hear by one ear and let it pass through the other one! But DO NOT ARGUE WITH THEM. it'll consume your and their both's energy and will lead to frustration. Will never get you anything even if you turned out to be right..\n\n( **_Sorry,_**but I had to repost. Bcz I messed up in the previous post. And I lost the purpose of posting it.

The chances of you getting real motivation to study and then keep studying for long period of time are very less.\n.\n.\n\n\ud83d\udc49Now the tip.\n\n1. Don't resist your feelings and accept them.\n\n2. Take few deep breaths and be relaxed.\n\n3. And for the next 2-3, without wasting a single minute, plan what you have to study and then\n\n4. Sit to study there and then. not for the whole day not even for the next X no. hours but for the next 25 minutes only. tell yourself that you're free after these 25 mins, even if you don't want to study the rest of the whole day its your choice. but during these 25 minutes you have to study. whether you feel like it or not.\nThat's it.\n\n\n(please, pardon my grammer mistakes, hope I make you a little bit understand what I'm trying to say)",

It's your fault that you've procrastinated. Instead of incrementally studying, you've spent most of your time on pointless things instead. You don't have to study a full 12 hours a day. You can do it bit by bit, spending 2 hours or even 3 hours just so you can chip off that workload. \"But OP, even if I do that I still won't be able to finish all my materials.\" So what? Nobody does. It's better than doing nothing. \"But OP, I have adhd and I can't focus if I don't have my meds.\" Are you kidding me? You know you have a problem, and you haven't even tried fixing it without taking meds? I would assume that the majority of you would complain saying that you're dumb. When you're just actually lazy. \n\nLet me guess. The reaction of most of you after failing a major exam even though you didn't study jack, is \"I'm so stupid. I couldn't even pass that subject.\" Yeah of course dumbass, you didn't pass because you didn't study. You didn't pass because you procrastinated. \n\nIf you're still reading, use the last two of your brain cells and use anki to memorize your materials and cmaptools in order to create a concept map on what you know, so that you'll be able to evaluate your current knowledge of the topic. \n\nI'm sick and tired of you people who are asking for help on how they could study hundreds of pages or even thousands of pages in a day in order to ace an exam. Yeah like speed reading's gonna help you bud, good luck. \n\nInstead of seeing good study methods in this sub, I always see people complaining about how people have little time left before a major exam.",

I'm like this with a lot of things in life, not just homework, I always put things off and procrastinate and end up not doing them or giving up.  \n\nI don't even know why I'm writing this, cus I know the answer of what I need to do but I still don't do it. It's been like this for over a year since I've started sixth form(where you study between ages 16-18 in the UK) and I've just been failing this maths class consistently because I haven't been putting in enough work.",

Observationally, this kind of seems to give me a sort of \"excuse\" to procrastinate on other things, like tidying up my room. Basically, I tell myself that I can either spend time doing 1. \"Entertainment\" or 2. \"Productive stuff\", and if I want to do category 2, I ought to do the overdue homework cause it's more urgent. Over the timeframe of days, the overdue homework doesn't accumulate progress, and nothing else does either. It's not a terribly long homework, but it might take 3 hours, it's the sort of boring stuff it's very hard not to procrastinate on. Does anybody else have a similar experience?\n\nIt also seems that my anxiety has gotten worse, and I started sleeping in later.

It was a duo project, and the assignment was split into 2 parts. The first part was about construction information and researching stuff about it, the other part about physics and calculation stuff (like making an existing building and making it into a selfsustaining home in 2050). I was sick during the first try we got, he finished his part and that was good.\n\nThe deadline of the second attempt is in 2 weeks (March 18th 12:00 PM).

Since the late years of high school I've had an issue with always last minute completing my assignments, doing them  a few hours before it's due. I had bad marks in highschool, but made it into university, where the habit carried on, but my procrastination got progressively worse. Over the 6 years I've managed to avoid being suspended because of my uni's lenient policy regarding fails, as of now I've failed over 15+ classes, mainly because of my inability to hand in assignments on time or at all. \n\nI've tried implementing most procrastination tips I've read online: breaking down into chunks, setting a schedule, using social media site blockers, going to the library, etc. Even if I'm not doing anything at all, I'll still manage to stare at the wall or ceiling and be stuck in my own head, instead of doing my assignment. I don't seem to have a problem with quizzes or tests and will do them. It's just when it comes to assignments it's like I have a big impenetrable wall that is painful to get out of. I thought that getting a full time job related to my degree would help with my motivation to complete this final year of university but I'm still struggling at the moment. I'm really at a loss on how to overcome this, as I don't think I'm a lazy person having a full time job and all, but when it comes to university assignments my brain just wants nothing to do with it. Wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar or has any advice on how to get out of this decade long rut.",

        "post": "Hi everyone!\n\nRecently, I had this idea for an anti-procrastination website. It would make planning easier and force you to work on your homework. At first, I want to make this for students (particularly high school as I am a sophomore), but I will branch this out to other areas.\n\nHere are a couple features that I thought of:\n* Creates a plan of action when given all your homework\n* Focus mode with website blocker (will have occasional breaks)\n* Plans out big projects and tests to prevent all-nighters or cramming\n* Calendar to see plans for the next week/month\n* If you do not have much time, it will prioritize homework and move unimportant work to later days\n* A mobile app to stop phone procrastination and to input homework when away from a computer\n\nThese are only a couple ideas for this project. I want to make it similar to the system in How to be a Straight A Student. That is the system I use and it works well. \n\nLately, I have been procrastinating way too much. It's getting in the way of my grades and my social life. Since I sit in front of my computer for hours, I don't have any time to hang out with my friends or leave my house. All of my time is being wasted by procrastination. This has been happening to me all year, and I have been suffering. I want to create this to stop my own procrastination as well as others'. \n\nI wrote this post to ask you if this is something you would be interested in. Would you use it? Are there any suggestions or ideas that you have? I want this to benefit as many people as possible, as much as possible, so any input on my idea would be greatly appreciated. \n\nTL;DR: Thinking of making an anti-procrastination website.

During those times, because I was broke and didn<t care for social interactions, I would just stay home to save money and chill. Result: I fell into gaming and became sort of a routine, something I need. I feel like it<s getting in the way of my life and don<t wanna make it a worst addiction than it already is.\n\nA trick I found in the past was installing Linux on my main PC. it helped for a while but most my friends always poke me to come game and such, make fun of me because i'm on Linux and can't play games with them (all in good fun) and after 5-6 weeks, during holidays and semester was over, went back to Windows and started back.\n\nOther things I tried:\n\n\\- Started using a calendar to schedule job/classes/study blocks\n\n\\- I paid a yearly gym subscription (but only went once lul)\n\n\\-I stopped playing when my girlfriend is at home not sleeping\n\nThing is, I enjoy it quite a bit but I would like tips and tricks to help me reduce in a healthy way.

        "post": " \n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 8 because I was very hyperactive and my parents took me to the doctor, I took some medication for about a month then never took it again. I was also an excellent student in primary school, always having the best grades and didn't have to study at all.\n\nNow I'm 17, a month away from my final high school exam on arguably the hardest branch in my 3rd world country (I seriously regret choosing that brunch) and I cannot seem to get myself to consistently study at all.\n\nI've always knew I had ADHD but I've been told that the symptoms usually disappear at \\~15 so I never thought much of it, always linked my procrastination habits to laziness, but this year it's been getting so much worse. I cannot get out of bed in the morning anymore until the school bus is literally 10 minutes away from coming to my house, I cannot focus on my homework for more than 30 minutes and I get very easily distracted by video games and social media until time passes by and I can't grab the hold of it at all. I suck at time management, I've wasted so much time that I could've spent studying and now I feel so much behind and I'm feeling like a failure. Coffee and music help a bit, but definitely not enough.\n\nMy parents tell me that I'm just being lazy and that even if I wanted to get medication for it I can't since mental health is so neglicted in my country that ADHD medication is very rare (they had struggled a lot to get it when I was younger), and doctors don't seem to care about ADHD for teens/adults at all.\n\nIn the past years my grades haven't been that bad and I actually managed to get a very good overall grade last year (although the exam was pretty easy for everyone and I got ranked top 50% in my school, still felt very proud), but this year I've flunked almost all my exams and it's getting extremely hard for me and I don't even feel like I have enough time to study for the final exam. School schedule is extremely loaded, we study 6-8 hours a day every day, even on Sundays and it's been stressing me A LOT. I am breaking down and don't know what to do anymore. Maybe medication would help me, but that option is ruled out anyway.",

        "post": "I am currently writing my thesis on interventions for problematic social media usage, and found a promising intervention to reduce procrastination. Here is only the first of the six steps, but it can work stand-alone:\n\n**Step 1:** understand why procrastination on social media happens. It will help you reduce it. Here are the causes of social media induced procrastination:\n\n* **Poor expectation management,** coming from beliefs like \u201cmy friend expect me to reply almost instantly when they send a message, no matter the time\u201d\n* **Impulsiveness and lack of self control,** for example when receiving a notification\n* **Poor time management**\n* **Habitual checking,** i.e. checking your phone / social media purely out of habit. This behavior has increasingly been normalized\n* **Social norms**, e.g. believing that procrastinating with social media is a non-harmful behavior because \u201ceverybody else does it\u201d\n\nAnd here are some practices that can help you reduce social media induced procrastination:\n\n* **Digital resilience:** Avoid getting overly affected emotionally by what you see online. A large percentage of what you see online is not a reflection of the real world. The information on social media is filtered to maximize your engagement.\n* **Accept to be imperfect:** Be ok that you might not always reply to a message as soon as people would like, accept that you cannot please everyone\n* **Express yourself to others:** You can manage your family / friends\u2019 expectations by telling them when you are free to interact with them on social media, and when you are busy.\n* **Set limits**: For example limit notifications\n* **Positive thinking:** for example, if you had sent a message to someone and found that they had read your message but hadn\u2019t yet replied, instead of obsessing over it you could choose to think more positively about the situation; they might have been busy at the time and needed more time to reply. Methods like this also help you develop more understanding and empathy towards others, and help you distance yourself from situations that might otherwise cause you anxiety.\n\nIf you want to look at the full intervention, I can send it on DM or you can look for \"D-Crastinate\" on google scholar. It seems like I cannot post links on this subreddit.  \n**Disclaimer:** This post is part of a series of posts around social media problematic use, and interventions related to it. I am currently writing my MSc thesis on it, and publishing my findings online, and I do not have any incentives or economic affiliation with the authors of the intervention.",

Med school burnt my energy and motivation so much, in the end I am probably even below average as an MD.  \n\n  \nMy psychiatrist friends tell me that I am on autism spectrum, and have ADHD, which is a classic combo as a diagnose these days. I am fine being me, but my complaint is that I procrastinate. And I have brilliant ideas, realistically reachable goals, but still I have so little motivation to reach them. \n\n  \nMany people advised me to see a therapist but the problem is, I know the doctor side of those therapies and those therapists are usually not healthy minds themselves. They dont have passion for their jobs, they are also social media addicts and they are also burnt out. And so, I cannot trust any of them since they could not even help themselves in the first place. Not to be disrespectful, but I need someone in a better situation than me, to guide me. Otherwise I just cant trust their advice, so therapy wont work. \n\n  \nEven if there are good therapists that specifically treats procrastination, I would take my chances with apps. Because computers are absolute, and they are trustworthy. I can see myself following instructions from a robot, but not from a person. So, I was wondering which mental health apps would be suitable for my exact problem. Doesnt have to be free btw, as long as it gives me solid instructions to follow to beat my procrastination habits.

        "post": "I think this subreddit contains enough helpful solutions for the many procrastinating posts I\u2019m seeing lately. I want to try to explain **why** we\u2019re prone to procrastinate. \n\nWe tend to choose the easiest activities over the most rewarding. We have two faulty beliefs: life should be easy and our self-worth is dependent on our success. Procrastinating allows us to delay putting our reputations on the line until later. This is an ego-protective maneuver.\n\nThis has a neural foundation: our limbic system (supporting behavior, emotion) seeks immediate rewards and comes into conflict with our prefrontal cortex (supporting executive functions like planning, decision making, problem-solving, self-control) which understands the consequences of falling behind. Both regions run on dopamine but have different actions in each.\n\nDopamine in the prefrontal cortex causes us to stay on task and focus while dopamine in the limbic system causes us to feel pleasure. We put things off whenever the desire for immediate pleasure (social media, unnecessary or unproductive work) wins out over our ability to delay gratification. \n\nIf our self-confidence *and* the value of the task are high, we\u2019re less likely to procrastinate. This is pitted against two factors: how soon will the reward come and how distractable we are. Which means, if the length of time it will take to complete the task is high **or** our distractibility is high, this will lead to an increase in procrastination.",

        "post": "I watched an average of  3 hours of YouTube  PER DAY for the last 2 years. It didn't \"ruin my life\", but it certainly made life difficult in some sense. Recently, I realized what really kept me in the YouTube rabbit hole for hours on end every day...\n\nI just kept scrolling.\n\nI scrolled through the homepage to find a video that caught my attention, I scrolled through the comments while the video was playing. I scrolled everywhere!\n\nI noticed that social media apps and websites promote one thing: **scrolling**.\n\nAnd if you just stop scrolling, you'll save precious time that you can spend, doing anything better than scrolling, like talking to the cute girl that's in front of you in the grocery shop.\n\nHere's how to implement it:\n\nWhenever you open a social media app, take one second and think why did you actually open the app. Do you want to pass time? Are you trying to escape some thoughts? Or are you just putting off important work? \n\nDon't judge your answer, even if you know you are procrastinating. \n\nNow that the intention is clear and you still want to use the app/website, I want you to implement one rule: \n\n**Don't scroll on the homepage!**\n\nYou can scroll on your profile page or your watch later playlist or your saved Reddit posts, but you cannot scroll on the homepage of the app or the website.\n\nYou might think that it defeats the purpose of social media, but it's not like that.\n\nWe often save some amazing videos on Watch Later or some great articles on Reddit saves, but we don't go through them because they are often longer and more boring than cat videos.\n\nThis method has helped me save literal hours and I've been accomplishing a lot more. \n\n**IMPORTANT: Cut yourself some slack!**\n\nAll of the major social media platforms are spending millions of dollars to make people waste time, so you need to have some compassion for yourself if you do realize that you've been spending hours scrolling on Instagram because after all, it is you vs. a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\nSo please don't get depressed if you catch yourself during a cat video binge. It is okay.\n\nWhat are your unique techniques to stay productive? I'll love to know!",

        "post": "Let me share the question that is changing my life.\u00a0The question I keep asking myself several times a day. The question that saves me from mindless procrastination. The question that helps me be the best version of myself even when I don\u2019t feel like it.\n\nThis question is\n\n## \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? If not this, then what?\u201d\n\nLet me explain it using some real-life examples.\n\n## Scenario #1\n\nYou have scheduled to work on an important project. Maybe it\u2019s an essay for school or a report for work. You even put it on your schedule to work on it for two hours starting from 3 pm. It\u2019s 2:55 pm and you are starring at this task, clearly not wanting to do it.\n\n*Ugh. Not this again! Not today! Why me? Why now? Why do I always need to do these things?\u00a0I don\u2019t want to do it. It\u2019s hard. I can do it tomorrow. What if I don\u2019t do it at all? It\u2019s unrealistic to finish it in one day. I\u2019ll have more energy next week\u2026*\u00a0\n\nSounds familiar?\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you ask yourself, \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative?\u201d meaning \u201cIf not this, then what?\u201d.\n\nHere is the secret.\n\nYour brain already has a specific activity prepared for you to do when you decide to give up on your hard task. It has it ready. And you know it.\u00a0**What is the activity your brain wants you to do instead of doing the work you have planned for yourself?**\u00a0What will you do if you decide to skip doing the planned task? You already know what will be your next step. Let me guess\u2026\n\n* check Facebook\n* check your email\n* read news\n* read sports news\n* play a game on your phone\n* browse social media\n* watch videos on YouTube\n* text friends in a group chat\n* lie down on a couch and watch TV\n\nDid I get it right?\n\nOk, it\u2019s 2:55 pm. You look at your schedule and see \u201cComplete Project X\u201d scheduled from 3-5 pm. You start thinking all those thoughts\u00a0but instead of indulging in them and letting them control you, all you need to do is to ask yourself, \u201c**Ok, what\u2019s the alternative? If not this, then what?**\u201d\n\nAnd this is where the magic happens. That\u2019s when you catch a thief *before* he attempts to break into your house.\n\n*\u2013 I don\u2019t want to do it; it\u2019s hard; I can do it tomorrow\u2026 yada yada.*\u00a0\n\n*\u2013 Ok, what\u2019s the alternative? If not this, then what?*\n\n*\u2013 Go on Facebook or LinkedIn and just scroll\u2026 for the rest of the workday.*\u00a0\n\n*\u2013 Umm\u2026 WHAT???*\n\n*\u2013 Ooops, did I say it out loud? It was supposed to be a secret! \\*Facepalm\\**\n\nAnd that\u2019s how we catch a time thief before he breaks into the house.\n\nWhen you ask yourself, \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative?\u201d you are not hiding from the truth. You already know what you are going to do once you decide to bail on the important task. You know. *You knoooow.*\u00a0What\u2019s your poison of choice? Facebook? News site? Twitter? Email?\n\n**There is only one activity the lizard part of your brain wants you to do instead of working on Project X**. And it\u2019s usually not something you would consciously choose to do.\n\n## Scenario #2\n\nYou finish your work. You have your dinner. Ideally, you want to go for a long walk or go to the gym. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve planned for yourself. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve put on your new year\u2019s resolutions list for\u2026 how many years now?\n\nBut\u2026\n\n*-Sigh. I\u2019m tired. I had this difficult meeting at work. And that colleague of mine totally pissed me off. I don\u2019t want to go for a walk\u2026*\n\n*\u2013 Ok, what\u2019s the alternative? If not this, then what?*\n\n*\u2013 Lie down on the couch and watch Netflix for the rest of the day. And let\u2019s eat that bag of Cheetos while we are at it.*\n\nWhen your brain is feeding you \u201cI\u2019m tired.. I don\u2019t wanna do it\u201d all it wants you to do is to cancel the activity you have planned and do the one activity it chose for you instead. It already knows the activity it wants you to do. It is picked, packed, and ready to be shipped. And you will do it on auto-pilot once you decide to cancel your plans.\n\nThe question of \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? If not this, then what?\u201d reveals this activity. And once we uncover this activity we realize how silly and undesirable it is. Once we say it out loud. Once it\u2019s out of the dark. It\u2019s not something our conscious mind will ever choose to do. It\u2019s not something we will ever put in our planner. We will never want to put it on our new year resolutions list. These activities usually happen on autopilot. We realize that we are doing them only\u00a0*after*\u00a0the fact. *After* we spent few hours on Instagram. *After* we binge-watched an entire season of a new show on Netflix. *After* we finish the whole bag of chips.\n\nOur prefrontal cortex engages *after* this \u2018lizard brain\u2019 activity is complete. It analyses the damage. That\u2019s when you feel a familiar bouquet of emotions: guilt, disgust, and disappointment. You are looking at the ruins of your day. The time thief came in, stole the valuable time and left.\n\nWhen a student realizes the action the\u00a0lizard brain is trying to get her to do is to spend hours on Facebook instead of writing an essay, her prefrontal cortex is in the position to say \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to waste hours observing other people\u2019s lives. I would rather spend it creating the best life for myself by completing this assignment.\u201d\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhenever you feel a desire to procrastinate and bail on your own plan, the lizard part of your brain is trying to make you do a certain activity. It doesn\u2019t want you to know what the activity is, it just wants you to not want to do an activity you have planned. It will give you a bunch of excuses of why you shouldn\u2019t be doing that activity.\n\nIf you ask yourself \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? If not this activity, then what?\u201d your lizard brain will reveal the activity it had prepared for you. And once you see that activity in daylight, hopefully, you will realize that it\u2019s not something you want to\u00a0*consciously*\u00a0invest your time in.\u00a0*Thanks but no thanks.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis article first appeared on [monthlymethod.com/blog/](https://monthlymethod.com/blog/)",

But after a few weeks of productivity, they get back in on their *socmeds* and revert to their distracted selves.\n\nThey have been doing this kind of thing for years, and I am curious if this is really a good habit.

But I just don't even sometimes realize like how much phone I'm using and constantly staying on electronics. I don't really know how to deattach from this problem. I'm really feeling like I'm wasting critical time to learn new skills and leverage more opportunities because using phone has created short term attention span where watching 15 min about certain topic just feels off-putting. Can't even focus and implement what I read or watch but if it's social media then yeah obviously mind gets interested. It's just really causing negative impact and your mental emotional physical well being gets disrupted. Sometimes you realize internally like okay, get up time to do some work but you keep procrastinating saying 5 more mins that turns into 2 hours and youre just sitting in one place. Then once you come out of this phase, you ultimately start to feel self hatred and guilt.",

        "post": "This has been the bane of my existence has probably made me miss out on meetings with friends etc.  \nHeres a few problems I face:  \nYoutube, instagram, discord, video game and sometimes porn usage high. Going analogue would help here but as I will say later on I need the internet for both research articles and classes.  \nSome friends seemingly wanting to be contacted over social media only (or preferred). So whilst its only happened once one of my friends told me specifically that they prefer to use snapchat for communication. This kinda prevents me from using texting or phone calls to prevent me possibly getting lost down the social media hole.  \nUnable to properly switch off iphone to something like a dumbphone since possible problems with qr code and sending photos to such a phone. In addition to that I would say for my classes you need to watch the live or recording to do the work and theres no way around it.  \nLose track of time when online, because even though I am wearing a watch and my computer has a clock on the bottom right corner, it enough to tell how much time has been wasted.  \nIssue becomes so bad that sometimes im barely scraping through with my grades and have time for a few friend activities at most.  \nNot only that I have a feeling its slowed me down in general since I dont have much to do, there isn\u2019t a need to be overall faster.  \nFriends using mobile phone when nearby, prompting me to look at phone cause idk what to talk about  \nI think sometimes I\u2019m quite stubborn to change and idk how to fix it. I mean sure advice like trying to get yourself to do a little bit of something can be helpful, but it isn\u2019t enough when by the end of the term your like 5 weeks behind content and frantically catching up till your about 2 weeks behind.  \nI am just wondering since many of my irl friends are distance now how to keep in contact with them on social media apps like discord, without doing things like endlessly browsing memes. Even right now as I\u2019m typing this post, I\u2019ve got 2 days left to submit a 1000 word assignment that I have only typed 10 words of and havent done any research. This is so frustrating for me.  \nSome things that I have tried include:  \nScreentime for iphone, I even typed in a random password that I would forget to prevent me disabling it. Did not work as could press a single button and skip the screentime message. Though the good thing about it is it tells you what apps you have been on, I wish it was websites too though. Though if anyone has tips on how to use it better I would accept.  \nFlora /forest for iphone: only works when i either remember that I have a task to do + cant use things like camera app if i need to use photos for something. Also tells me how much time I have been doing what  \nCold turkey: definitely helps a bit, but must keep blocks on otherwise I lose track of time again with games. Also tells you how much time you have been doing for what.  \n30 min timer on watch for video games. Reminds me I need to do something but often I ignore it sadly and then I end up losing 2-3 hours or more.  \nI think one of the main reasons why I waste so much time is that I one am uncertain with what I want to do with my life as well as difficult and long tasks that I need to endure.  \nI know I have asked before, but any advice on how to mitigate this without losing out on time with friends both online and in person?",

        "post": "I noticed that recently during the work-from-home period, I've procrastinated more than I'd like to admit. So I wondered, what exactly is making that happen?\n\nWell, there's a school of thought which proposes that procrastination is emotionally driven and this BBC article sums it up quite well: [Why procrastination is about managing emotions, not time](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200121-why-procrastination-is-about-managing-emotions-not-time)\n\nIt feels like the emotional impact of this pandemic in the context of productivity is overlooked with regards to working from home, and our expected levels of productivity. First of all, we shouldn't expect ourselves to be as productive as before. We're working in an environment that is not tailored for productivity - rather, it's built for comfort. This is a constant theme I've found when talking with colleagues and friends: the **emotional impact** of the pandemic hurts their productivity. \n\nThe 24 hour news cycle talks about COVID-19 all the time, and how it has been impacting communities worldwide. That, and social media too (including Reddit). \n\nIf news like that makes you anxious, this can drive you to procrastinate. With the pandemic on your mind, you can't focus quite clearly - or at least, that's what I've been experiencing. I'm curious, how have you dealt with the emotional impact of the WFH experience?",

        "post": "I (age 43) am having a difficult time getting motivated and staying disciplined.  I have a hard time waking up in the morning.  I waste time scrolling social media.  It's a stress releaver or as a way to put off important tasks that I should be focusing on.\n\nBelow is some background of my situation: \n\n**Business :**\n\n* My business was all but destroyed by the pandemic.  We are still operating, but we might not survive much longer given the loss in reserves and working capital, which I was forced to use to keep the business afloat during the worst of the pandemic when we had very little revenue.\n* Furthermore, the business is still slow compared to prior to March of 2020.  This is industry-wide, not specific to my business only. \n\n**Marriage / Personal Life:**\n\n* My marriage fell apart during this time.  I have finally accepted what happened and the most difficult days are behind me, but it was the worst experience of my life and the most painful thing I've gone through.  We also have three kids, so that has made it even harder as they are everything to me and not having as much time with them (raising them) as I had always envisioned is beyond soul-crushing.\n* I realize these life events happen, but it was a lot at once and I seemed to lose my drive and ambition.  I've felt like I'm in a slump and my confidence is at an all-time low. \n* Before these setbacks, my vision for the future included my wife and kids and it is what drove me to work extremely hard.  It sounds stupid now, but I was all-in on the marriage.  I had never considered divorce, so it blindsided me when my wife left me.  My wife and kids were my \"why?\" in relation to my goals and future. \n\n**In summary:**\n\n* I had a great life prior to March of 2020.  Fast forward three years and my business and marriage are destroyed.  \n* I'm under financial stress and dealing with debt issues for business debt and a loan for a commercial building that we bought in 2017, but it's lost approximatley 30% - 40% of its value since March of 2020.  I personally guaranteed both of these loans, which was a big mistake. \n* I'm in my early 40's and I feel like I\"m starting over in life.  The age part is also making it difficult because I never thought I'd be in this position in my 40's.\n\nI can't afford a coach, but I was wondering if anyone has suggestions or if there were any processes or tools that you used to get back on track.  Even a PDF workbook or a book that does what a coach would do for you to get back on track and stop wasting away your life....or really anything that has helped you.\n\nThank you in advance for any help or advice!\n\nTK\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post": "Hey, friends!\n\nMomentum is the antidote to procrastination. It\u2019s that feeling, \u201cI\u2019m actually making progress here. Let\u2019s keep going.\u201d With momentum, we can accomplish anything.\n\nOne thing that destroys momentum is paying attention to the news.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Today\u2019s news, or infotainment, has the perfect blend of drama, fear, and outrage. All of these create uncertainty and anxiety.\n\n*Who works toward big audacious goals when the world might end at any moment?*\n\nI certainly don\u2019t!\n\nHere\u2019s an embarrassing example: During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, I allowed the news to destroy my afternoons and my momentum.\n\nEvery day, I watched a press briefing with lunch. Steamed rice, vegetables, soy sauce, and a briefing were my go-to meal. I consumed national briefings (I love drama) and local ones (I want to feel informed).\n\nAfterward, I watched briefings from California and New York\u2014they had the most cases, the most bodies, and the most drama. (Did I mention I love drama?)\n\nLive briefings gave me the thrill of something happening right now. But I actually preferred recorded ones, watching at 2X speed. (This gave me time for *moar* briefings.)\n\nI also indulged in the endless commentary and the commentary on the commentary.\n\nBut all of this exhausted me. I felt overwhelmed by what was happening; I felt uncertain about the nation\u2019s health and economy and future; I felt outraged over leaders\u2019 inconsistent responses and bizarre antics.\n\nAnd yet I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I couldn\u2019t stop the pandemic; I couldn\u2019t fix the economy; I couldn\u2019t change leaders\u2019 behavior (or swap them out for better ones).\n\nDaily press briefings filled me with dread, and I felt helpless and hopeless. Is it any wonder I was unmotivated to work after lunch? Is it any wonder I procrastinated?\n\nIt was impossible to build momentum at work with this maelstrom of negative feelings. The rational part of my little brain knew this was taking a toll. (Yes, there\u2019s a rational side I occasionally listen to.)\n\nSo one day, I just stopped. Stopped the daily briefings; stopped the never-ending commentary. I took an emotional break from it all.\n\nImmediately, I felt better\u2014well, not better\u2014but I felt less bad about the world. My mood improved, as expected. Surprisingly, my productivity skyrocketed within a couple of days. With less negative energy swirling inside me, building momentum was actually possible.\n\nThese days, I\u2019m careful with the news I consume. I strive to avoid it before dinner. If I\u2019m honest, I still glance at headlines from time to time. My little brain still craves drama and excitement. But I\u2019m mindful of this, and I protect my time and energy.\n\nAnd that\u2019s my advice to you: Protect your emotional energy. Don\u2019t let infotainment destroy your mood during work hours.\n\nWhen listening to briefings or broadcasts or pundits, ask:\n\n1. Will this help me achieve my goals?\n2. Am I just looking for drama?\n\nSpend less time looking for cheap thrills and more time working toward big goals. Focus on what\u2019s in your circle of control, and strive to ignore everything else.\n\nDo this for a year, and you\u2019ll be amazed at what you accomplish.",

        "post": "Before the pandemic, when we still had face-to-face classes and office work, I noticed that I was one of the most productive and disciplined guys within my friend group. I came to this realization when one of my friends genuinely complimented and asked me how and why I was so organized and disciplined. \n\nI always slept early, woke up early, did all my school works immediately, had all my tasks meticulously scheduled on my to-do list and I rarely or even never procrastinated. Even with this productivity, I was still able to manage my time well enough to enjoy life and with friends and family.\n\nAll this went away as the pandemic went by. My strict 10pm-5am bedtime turned to 5am-1pm. I procrastinate on all my assignments and school works in college down to the day of the deadline. I don't have any motivation to do and learn things that will better me as a person. I feel like I'm just letting life go by.\n\nMy question is how? How will I be able to get back the discipline and productivity that I used to have? Or is this just normal due to the pandemic and I shouldn't be too hard on myself?",

However I am really more looking for advice on how I can approach work without procrastinating, it would be especially helpful if you\u2019ve had experience on how to deal with mental health issues while still getting work done. \n\nI understand that the knee-jerk reaction will be to not put so much pressure on myself, but realistically I am not in a place where I can avoid these applications, so any tips on how to move forward would be really helpful.

        "post": "Hi. I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but I need some tips and/or input.\n\nI've had procrastination issues for as long as I remember, ESPECIALLY in school. I had to take a break from college and procrastination was one of the big reasons and was apart of a bigger problem (I think). (Hopefully a \"recharge\" should eliminate most of my issues... I needed a break anyway, and this pandemic really turned things upside down.)\n\nWith the time I have from my break, I wanted to focus on hobbies and the projects within them that had to be postponed as for back as four years because of school, and want to complete them before I go back to school in the fall so that I have no worries.\n\nI have one issue though... at first, I thought my procrastination mostly affected the school the worst. I am now noticing that I'm procrastinating on my projects too... I don't want this. Makes me worry about school when I go back.\n\nMy goal is to do something everyday... I've tried breaking it down into smaller bits and timing myself (Pomodoro) but usually it ends up not working after two cycles and it just fades off. I've even tried blocking most distractions and that doesn't seem to worth very well.\n\nWhat else can I do? Is this a sign of a deeper issue? Executive Dysfunction?",

It got worse to the point where procrastination and abandoning tasks and basically everything became a daily habit. I've always felt unmotivated despite yearning to do so much more. I would basically spend a lot of time planning and consuming a lot of information that I never implemented. The pandemic and the fact that my peers are lightyears ahead of me socially and in life generally, didn't make it any better.\n\nHowever, last year I decided that it's time I start living and not just let time pass by( but nothing crazy like travelling, extreme sports or trying to be a millionaire by 30). I've decided to take on some habits, creating a system to be more productive and so I could feel like I've done something with my time instead of just passing time.\n\nI have decided to create a private community/membership for people who are basically like me and want to better themselves either by being more productive or challenging themselves. I figured there are people out there who would appreciate simple gamified challenges, practical productivity tools/guides/templates that are not so overwhelming, a community of people from which they can learn and find accountability partners, etc.\n\nIf you wanted to subscribe to a community like this, how much would you be willing to pay monthly?\n\nHow much time would you want to spend consuming content and on exercises/challenges every week? (30 minutes, 1 hours, etc.)\n\nWhat sort of resources/tools would you be willing to pay for? (e.g. templates, guided exercises, newsletters).",

        "post": "For as long as I can remember, I've always sucked at school. I'm pretty slow when it comes to learning and have gotten bad grades starting the 4th grade, which significantly got worse all throughout High School. Not for the lack of trying, because I did try, but I'll admit I don't exactly know how to study and I don't remember a time where I ever actually did study seriously. I almost didn't march up the stage for my High School graduation because of how bad my grades were, so when I actually got to, I vowed and swore to myself that college would be different. Or at least that's what I thought.\n\nTurns out, college was even worse because it dawned on me after my first year that my passion was in writing and not art. I couldn't change courses/track/majors because of financial problems so I told myself to suck it up and just get through three more years. Then I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression my second year, I failed a lot of classes, and so three years became four. I'm now on my sixth year, a semester away to graduating, but this pandemic and the lack of structure has made me realize that maybe I wasn't just dumb (something people in High School had associated me with) but that I was extremely lazy too.\n\nThe thing is, I was already performing badly during the normal school setting. When the rest of the semester got canceled and switched to online, I became even worse. I ended up never turning in a few requirements even though I knew the deadlines and consequences (I got an 'Incomplete' as my grade so it was more or less an extension to submit my missing works), and I also forgot about the existence of a subject (which is just crazy to me, but I genuinely forgot and I didn't end up submitting a single thing for the class and was marked 'Never Entered' which meant I had to take the class again, technically an F). If it was a normal school semester I definitely would've failed these classes but circumstances had professors lenient. When I found out about the status of my grades, you'd expect that someone would get right on to the overdue work, turn it in, and just fix it, right? I didn't do shit. I let it sit there for a month until my parents were eventually notified. Now it's been another month since they found out and my dad keeps asking me if I've heard from my 2 professors who gave me an 'Incomplete' and if they finally gave me a grade since \u201cI've submitted my missing works.\u201d Wrong. I compulsively lied again and again; I actually haven't started any of the requirements. It's been almost 3 months but I haven't submitted anything, and have just been stalling.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me. I know I should be doing them, but I always seem to get distracted and do something else \u2013 case in point, I finally got the energy to start on the paper but it hasn't even been 5 minutes till I decided that writing this down would be a better use of my time. I always wake up first thing in the morning with the best intentions, I obsessively make lists of things I want to do for the day but never end up going through with them. Procrastinating is the only thing that works for me (until recently, when I started not giving a shit about deadlines either). I always do things till the last second, I literally don't know any other way to do things. And it just sucks, because it seems like all I do is try and try but never actually *do*.\n\nSchool is starting in a few weeks and I'm worried of screwing up this last semester. I want to graduate, but it also got me thinking about the future when I finally get a job. Will I always be this undisciplined and lazy, with no work ethic? I feel so pathetic and dysfunctional. Doing things just get so excruciating sometimes that it's almost crippling and I'm just really really struggling, I don't know how else to deal with this.",

        "post": "I have a BIG procrastination problem. Since my job became fully remote during Covid (with optional highly irregular team meet ups) I find it incredibly hard to focus and just get simple, productive stuff done.\n\nFor instance, this afternoon (am in the UK), I had a short video call on a project update from 2pm till 2:30pm. Since then, I did nothing. I chatted to a mate about football on Slack, got lost in a nostalgic Wikipedia hole, and placed a couple of online bets. No idea what else without looking at my web history. \n\nI am a senior manager in a medium size business, and overall we are doing well. My department's results are fine, everyone in the team knows what they need to do (I think) and my boss seems perfectly content with my performance. But I literally just attend the meetings I need to and input into them, answer emails/Slack messages when the team ask questions, and occasionally take a few hours to pull together strategy documents, plans for the team or results presentations. I do what's needed, to a seemingly acceptable level. I also get paid a wage that makes me and the family very comfortable.\n\nI actually also really like the company, believe in its 'Why' and would love to deliver at a high level (which i believe I am capable of with my skills and experience) - but I simply CANNOT FOCUS. The lack of any social pressure to work from not being in an office has somehow degraded my inhibitions to such a degree that I waste hours at a time whenever I can get away with it.\n\nAnd I feel... icky about it. Like pretty empty and guilty. Not all the time, but it is certainly there. Obviously my biggest fear is that I fuck up and somehow lose my job or get punished in a similar way. But looming larger is just the idea I am wasting my days, not because I haven't found a job i find fulfilling (I do, when I do stuff) but because i have become chronically laxadaisical.\n\nI've tried quite a few tools to help - site blockers (but I just enter incognito mode to get around them), pomodoro method (I just ignore it) and others - and think i need some more brutal tools or advice to smash me out of this funk. Would be so grateful for anything you guys have to offer",

It's at the point where it affects almost every aspect of my life, since I'm never fully comfortable/unstressed since there's always the looming feeling there's more work to do, and the constant guilt of procrastination.\n\nEvery work day is pretty much the same, where I want to get stuff done but always end up spending hours on YouTube or other internet browsing, and either get nothing or very little done. As the day goes on I get more and more frustrated about how little I've accomplished, which is counter-productive since the more upset I get the more I want to retreat to YouTube and mindless scrolling. Even days at the office I feel scatter brained and unable to focus fully, and there's only a couple days a week where my team are actually there so going in on other days is pretty much just the same as working alone from home. \n\nI'm also pretty sure I have a terrible case of negative perfectionism, since frequently I can't bring myself to work on a task since I feel or know I'm doing soemthing wrong. Comparing myself to other coworkers I'm pretty sure I'm the least productive member of my team with the least know-how and passion for the work; I want to do well though, at least to the point where I can actually put in a full work day and not feel guilty after. I'm constantly paranoid I'm on the brink of being fired, and with how the economy currently is and just for my self confident I think I'd be absolutely crushed if I end up actually losing my job. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this before and made a positive change? Is there anywhere I can go for help with this?\n",

        "post": " I began noticing my attention span shortening, possibly in early November or the last days of October.\n\nSince I've been stuck in this incredibly dull city, my entire day consists of mindlessly scrolling through my phone, whether it's on Reddit, Instagram, or mostly YouTube.\n\nDespite being a second-year computer engineering student, I can barely write a simple \"hello world\" code. It's been five years since I last seriously studied, and I'm bewildered by how I achieved high marks in this demanding major.\n\nAs a child, I was consistently the smartest in class, even surpassing my brother. I possessed a remarkable memory, or at least that's what my parents and friends told me. I used to secure the highest marks without studying more than an hour a day.\n\nNowadays, my memory has significantly deteriorated over the past six months. Not to mention, my attention span is alarmingly short. Whether it's TV shows, movies, or tutorials, I can't focus for more than 1 to 2 seconds without zoning out.\n\nBy zoning out, I mean completely disconnecting, unable to think about anything. This, according to what I've read on Reddit, stems from my severely damaged attention span, preventing my brain from processing information.\n\nIn summary, I feel like an entirely different person, as if I've been reset into someone who is unintelligent. Although junk food was a significant part of my life, this problem only arose recently.\n\nAs for entertainment, I used to binge-watch the TV show Supernatural three times, finding it captivating for hours. However, even new TV shows fail to hold my attention for long now, regardless of their level of interest.\n\nIn an attempt to address my issues, I've significantly reduced my phone time, cutting Instagram by 95% and eliminating YouTube shorts completely. I don't even use TikTok, which is a positive change. Now, my phone usage is limited to quick Google searches for questions that pop into my head.\n\nI feel like my brain is devoid of dopamine due to my current situation, even if it involves something I'm genuinely interested in. I'm reaching out in the hopes that someone can offer assistance or connect me with someone who can help. Without intervention, I fear my career prospects may disappear, and I'm contemplating ending it all.\n\nThanks a lot in advance.",

        "title": "Need help on getting motivated and get better mental health",
        "post": "tldr: I need help with staying motivated and become happier\n\nhere is a little info about what is going on about my life/issues\n\n\nEver since COVID-19 started, my life has been going downhill. I began to feel increasingly depressed and lost all motivation to do anything. I ended up skipping assignments, leading to failing most of my classes, and needing to retake them. This cycle persisted for two years until I managed to regain a bit of motivation, just enough to pass my classes. At that point, I thought I had overcome my depression and could move on. For the next few years, I believed I was doing fine, but a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon a post by someone who shared a similar experience, and I began to recognize the issues I had been ignoring. I realized I had been lying to myself to feel better. because finishing assignments with the bare minimum effort was not true motivation. I was still trapped in a cycle where I would become sad because I didn't want to do anything, and then I would become even sadder because I couldn't get anything done. And the reality was that I had never truly escaped this loop. I struggled to focus, was easily distracted, and constantly procrastinated. When it came to research or reading, I found myself endlessly procrastinating, only to start trying at the last moment before the deadline. I would scrape by on assignments, barely investing any time or effort, with no real desire to learn. This made me feel like I hadn't gained anything from my coursework since I was just trying to pass the class instead of trying to learn. Another issue I've become aware of is how fragile my mental health is. I lie to myself that I'm no longer sad and have returned to my pre-COVID state, but even minor setbacks can send me back into sadness that can last for days or even weeks. I also tend to blame myself for everything and never open up about my feelings. I now realize that I need to talk with people who can relate to my experiences and help me navigate this situation instead of hiding my feelings, which is why I'm reaching out here now.\n\nI also tried many approach myself to get myself before trying to ask here right now, I see a lot of advice on getting motivation/build good habit that said that the best way to get motivation is do something for just 2 min every day and you can rebuild good habit, or break big task into smaller task to help get started but it didn't really work for me because I can't even get the motivation to start anything, let alone 2 min or small task, another advice I see people suggesting is getting more sleep, however I feel like I actually sleep to much, because how Im never motivated I always spend too long in bed before waking up, and most of the time I sleep for more than 12 hour on weekend, and unless I have something I must do I don't even leave my bed until lunch time and I feel like I should actually sleep less because sleep is taking away too much time that I could use on something else.\n\nso far the only thing advice most people suggest that I feel like helped me a bit was going to gym, I started going to gym roughly 2 month ago, I don't really feel like I got more motivation compared to before I went to gym, but it made me feel better because by going to gym, I was able to make myself healthier, and I can actually see improvements like I have little muscles now compared to none from before, even though I'm still pretty weak and is probably below averages but at least I was able to see something positive that happened, which is why I think I will be able to keep the habit of going to gym, but one key factor that helped me go to keep this habit is the fact that the gym is on path when I walk home so I can naturally just decide I should check it out when I see it with no other distraction in my mind, which is why I couldn\u2019t get the same motivations for other thing like doing my work since I get too distracting by other thing like youtube, and it really isn't on my path until they are near deadline and I must do them.\n\nEdit: before covid I had all A\u2019s in my class, and I had good balance between study, hobbies(art) and relaxing, and I still like art but I also can\u2019t get motivation to start drawing",

I've tried timeblocking, but without any kind of external accountability, I just ignore it and keep obsessing over things that probably don't matter that much. It very much feels like my \"head knowledge\" about productivity isn't translating into \"belief\" if that makes sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there practical ways I can overcome this?

        "post": "I personally believe procrastination stems from poorly setup surroundings and fixing up this lifestyle would surely help you to cast off those shackles that bind us to this over growing procrastination level.  \nQuick back story:  \nDuring my stay at university dorm back in 2015, I remember I used to be someone who'd study and grind hard during the late night hours for several years without hassle. As someone with an aversion towards consistency and sticking to the schedule prior to joining my university, I noticed an incredible shift on the way I conducted my life productively at university in contrast to being a big procrastinator during my high school.  \nI'm a 28 year old working professional who has now miserably fallen back into the old state of misery meeting my good old friend from high school \"the procrastinator\" once again who's now taking a toll on my mental health.  \nThe one and only step to break the procrastination and it's difficult:  \nMore screen time = More prone to procrastination. Go to your router page, disable the Wi-Fi and just have your PCs or laptops connected to the router using an Ethernet cable so that you could use only wired internet. The goal is to remove the Wi-Fi connectivity between your smartphone and router. As for smartphone is concerned, never spend money on cellular data charges and rely on your phone for just outgoing and incoming calls. Office work messages being missed? Install the app on your laptop. The objective here is to significantly reduce the screen time and distractions on your smartphone as much as possible. Have them downloaded everything offline including the navigation on your smartphone and you're good. This was an important point honestly cause when I started off living at the university dorm back in 2015, I had no access to the internet on my smartphone within the room I stayed in so quickly began to feel the boredom. Now this \"No-Wi-Fi setup\" at my dorm room majorly impacted me performing a nice smartphone detox in a way that it kicked the big procrastinator outta me for once and for all where I noticeably became consistent for 4 consecutive years and I managed to cracked the toughest examinations with terrific academic records in one of the most difficult engineering streams which I believed I couldn't have done it at all.  \nDestroy any potential distractions that gets in your way especially the most common thing we all know in this day and age is none other but the Internet being the direct enemy to you. The step I have mentioned above works like charm and if the above step is followed correctly, executing any sorta task even if it's debilitating becomes a child's play to begin with.  \nPlease tell me your screen time on your phone and how terrible your procrastination level is. Kindly share your comments. Thanks",

        "post": "Anyone who works hard whether thats studying or growing a business or becoming a top athlete has a motivation to do it, otherwise it wouldn't make sense to grind for something you have no interest in.\n\nPerhaps their external motivation is so strong that it overcomes the mental resistance of the hard work. For me that was the case. Years ago when I was obsessed with muscle gain and scoring high grades, it was mentally very easy for me to grind very hard continuously both in the gym and in college. I think most people would say I was very disciplined but actually I just felt very motivated.\n\nRight now my mental health is not so good, and I procrastinate almost everything. Even important things. I don't feel motivated anymore.\n\nI think the motivation to achieve my goals is psychologically smaller than my motivation to do things that immediately satisfy me. If this is the case, something would be wrong with my brain. Because rationally I know achieving my goals is more valuable than filling my days with instant gratification, but the way I feel about it is the opposite. I think my subconscious mind cannot properly calculate the value of my goals vs the value of instant gratification therefore it thinks instant gratification more valuable than my goals far in the future.\n\nIs lack of discipline just a failure of the subconscious brain to understand that goals are of more value than instant gratification? Is lack of discipline secretly a lack of feeling motivated?\n\nIs my subconscious brain just fucked up and therefore I can't get disciplined?",

Focusing on projects at work was nearly impossible, and I struggled to learn complex software systems. Exhaustion killed my short-term memory, and I couldn't recall discussions, details, and decisions from the day before. \n\nI felt like a black hole had siphoned my energy, and a thick fog had enveloped my mind. The result? I was much dumber than before, with my mental acuity ranking higher than a goldfish but lower than a turkey.\n\nSo guess what I did? I procrastinated! After all, why exert all that effort to learn a new software system if you're just gonna forget everything in ten minutes?\n\nThis went on for months with no relief. \n\nI tried many things, all to no avail. Eat more fruits and vegetables? Check. Go to bed earlier? Check. Watch motivational videos and read inspirational stories? Check, check, check.\n\nNothing seemed to work, and I felt kinda hopeless. Would this be my life going forward, being exhausted and unmotivated to do all but the bare necessities?\n\nAt some point, I saw my doctor for a routine physical and told him about my symptoms. He ordered some tests, and we discovered a vitamin D deficiency. (Turns out, this is common for people who work indoors or live in northern latitudes. I check both boxes!)\n\nI started a daily supplement, and it helped. Slowly, my energy began to return, and the mental fog began to lift. This motivated me to make other healthy choices. \n\nNow, my energy levels are like a battery. When it's at 100%, I'm cheerful and enthusiastic, and I feel unstoppable. And when it's at 0%, I can't pull myself out of bed, and no one wants to be around me!\n\nWhen I had a vitamin D deficiency, my battery couldn't go above 30%. It had a permanent dampener on it. I could pull myself out of bed and drag myself to work, but that was it. \n\nWhen I started taking a vitamin D supplement, my battery could go up to 45%. Then, I made other healthy choices\u2014like homemade smoothies with blueberries and leafy greens\u2014which nudged the limit higher.\n\nNowadays, I feel much better. Granted, my battery won't go to 90% most days, and I'm still working through lingering issues, but I'm in a much better spot than I was before.\n\nSo here's my advice to you: See your doctor. Tell them about any struggles with focus, procrastination, fatigue, sadness, etc. Some treatable ailment\u2014like ADHD, depression, sleep apnea, or a vitamin deficiency\u2014may lurk behind your procrastination.\n\nBut you can't fix what you don't even know about. So make an appointment and see your doctor.",

        "title": "The True Cure to Long-Term Procrastination",
        "post": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nProcrastination has long been a massive bane to my life.  I've danced with the devil long enough to understand what makes him tick, and how to conquer him.  The most common advice to stop procrastinating is \"Just do it.\"  Try telling someone who is depressed \"Just be happy.\"  It doesn't work.\n\nBefore we can solve procrastination, we have to understand it. \nWhy is it that we procrastinators can put off a paper or a project for weeks to months, just to do all the work the night before the deadline?  It is a feat of dedication and hard work to write a 10,000 word paper in 8 hours.  Yet procrastinators are viewed as lazy.\n\nA lazy person does not pull all nighters to complete assignments.  So if a procrastinator isn't lazy, why do they wait until the night before to even start most projects?  There are different reasons, but the two that prevail are fear and a lack of desire.\n\n**Fear**\n\nFear is an insidious reason to procrastinate.  It is subconscious, no one think's they are afraid of their English paper.  But they do want to do well on it.  In fact, they want to write the perfect paper.  Engage the defence mechanism, because we are afraid of failing our own expectations.  We will procrastinate until the fear of failing is overcome by the panic of missing the deadline.  If we do fail, we'll simply chalk it up to waiting until the night before, rather than our own inadequacies.\n\n**Lack of Desire**\n\nNo-one is excited to write a research paper about the Spanish Inquisition, unless it's about Monty Python.  While it appears the same from the outside, procrastination from a lack of desire is markedly different from fear.  With fear, the procrastinator desires very much so to do well.  Here, the lack of desire drives the procrastination.  You'd rather do anything else in the world then that pile of laundry.  Still, it won't do itself.\n\n**What Happens When Deadlines End?**\n\nAfter school, the important deadlines end.  No-one is waiting anxiously for that novel you want to write.  No-one is waiting for you to learn the guitar.  The gym will happily collect your membership dues whether you show up or not.  When deadlines end, and we're working with important creative projects that are self guided, procrastination extends into infinity.  It can last a lifetime.\n\n**Fear and a Lack of Desire Feed Each Other**\n\nWhen we fear something for too long, the desire we once held to complete it dissolves.  Dreams die a slow death.  Eventually, we start talking about woulda coulda shoulda, instead of I should, I can, I will.  If we put something off for too long, we begin to fear it.  The two driving factors of procrastination circle each other like sharks around a lone swimmer.  What we need, is a boat.\n\n**The only true cure to procrastination is to remove fear and to increase desire**\n\nIf we can eliminate fear and create strong desire, acting towards our goals becomes a pleasurable and rewarding experience.\n\n**Eliminating fear is not easy.**\n\nThere are two ways to do this:  Lowering your expectations, and increasing your proficiency.  You can only increase your proficiency through practice.  Trust me when I say that some of the greatest performers in the world get scared.  This aspect of fear elimination is demonstrated beautifully by Alex Honnold in *Free Solo*.  This man practiced his climbing route all day long for years.  He had every subtle movement memorized and ingrained in his brain before he decided to go through with his free solo of El' Capitan.  He became so good, fear went away.\n\nThe other way to eliminate fear is to remove expectations.  This can be achieved immediately.  Look at children.  Rarely are they afraid of being bad at something.  They learn to walk and talk anyway.  They learn to draw, run, sing.  They don't have any expectations, they only want to enjoy the process.  As we get older, we either put expectations on ourselves, or they are thrust upon us.  A personal example - I procrastinate heavily on writing, as I expect myself to do well.  I recently picked up photography.  Since it is very new to me, I have been strongly enjoying the process of improvement and learning.  I don't care if I take a bad picture.  I'm ecstatic if I get one good photo in a thousand.  Without expectations, I've been taking photos at almost every possible opportunity I've had.  But if I write something I think is hot garbage, it often feels like I've failed.  The disconnect here is that I didn't fail.  I achieved, simply to a lower standard.  Producing something, anything at all, is better than watching youtube for 7 hours on a Saturday.  Take the pressure off, remove your expectations.\n\n**Increasing Desire**\n\nWhether you have eliminated fear or not, and intense desire will overcome fear.  Figure out what you truly want out of life.  Be ambitious with these desires.  No one busts ass for a weekend vacation in Phoenix.  Figure out, in no uncertain terms, what you want to be in life.  Do you want to be a movie star dating a model?  Write that down.  Do you want to hit the Time's best seller list?  That's your goal.  Do you want to win the Indianapolis 500?  Then write it down.  Make your goal the best possible outcome for your life you can imagine, and condense that down as much as possible.  Take your time with this, sit with a pen and a notebook for hours if you must, and figure out exactly what you want out of life.  It's okay if that changes down the road, but your vision must be sufficiently compelling that you would do anything to achieve that goal.  Now, you must line up your actions with things which work towards the goal.  \n\nIf your goal is to sell a screenplay to a Hollywood studio, then you need to write every day.  The only way to achieve that goal is to become a master screenwriter.  The only way to become a master screenwriter is to write.  Write daily, and ferociously.  Remove expectations that what you write today has to be perfect.  Your goal isn't to write a perfect screenplay today, it's to sell a screenplay to Hollywood.  That won't happen until you become so good at what you're doing, its second nature, so don't worry about the journey.  The journey is the answer to the goal, and the only path to get you there.\n\n**A note about small tasks**\n\nIf you're a bad procrastinator, you may accumulate small tasks.  This effects me particularly at work, where after a few weeks of working on various big projects, I end up with a massive list of small jobs that feels overwhelming.  The solution I've found to this is the \"do it now\" mentality.  If a task will take you less than 10 minutes, don't ever write it down.  Just do it.  This is contrary to the post above.  But the fact of the matter here is that these small tasks pile up into an insurmountable beast.  These tasks are usually simple and menial.  You'll feel better for never having written it on your list, and you'll be able to focus on the important things.\n\n**Conclusion;**\n\nIf you struggle with procrastination, create a goal which is so powerful that you have no choice but to work towards it.  Remove expectations that your work has to be perfect, instead focusing on improvement, momentum, and taking action now.  You will eventually cross a threshold where you become so skilled that your work will carry you to your goal, so do not fear temporary failure.  Instead, fear the days where you do nothing at all.\n\nThanks for reading.  Any feed back or comments you guys have is more than welcome.  I hope this helped someone work towards their goal today.\n\n**The Simple Solution // TLDR;**\n\nTo change a long post into a short solution, take the following steps to eliminate procrastination.\n\n1: Take an hour or more and write down your goals in life.  Aim for the fences, don't hold back.  Be succinct.  Condense it down to fit on a 3\" x 5\" card.  The desire must be strong enough that you can work through fear.\n\n2: Each day, start your day by reading that index card.  Ask yourself, what 1 specific action can you take towards that goal today?  Do that.\n\n3: Repeat this every single day.  If you miss a day, don't sweat it.  Just jump back on board the next day.  Don't lose sight of that lofty goal.",

        "post": "I've been suffering with this depression for the past few days. Here's how it goes.\n\nWhen I wake up, I plan my day out to do some productive things. I end up procrastinating and realize how lazy I was till around 4-5 PM. By then, the sun is going down and I literally have little time. Then I become sad and depressed.\n\nI think the main thing keeping my from being productive are a lot of things: First, I just can't find the motivation to do those things and I get easily distracted. Second, I seem to have a large dependency on electronics for tasks. For example, I end up watching videos while clipping my nails, having to listen to music whenever I do a task, which ends up making me distracted and wastes a lot of time. Third: I have no energy to do these things. Most days I just literally can't do anything because every part of my brain says no.\n\nThis is what is causing this procrastination from things that truly matter. I am really tired of being on electronics 24/7, and I actually want to do productive things that are actually worth something. Every single day, I promise to myself that tomorrow will be a better day, but the better day never arrives. With this break having like 12 more days, I don't think I will end up sane by the time I get back to school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelp will be appreciated! ",

        "title": "How I used goals to overcome procrastination",
        "post": "For years I was notorious for putting things off. It wasn't that I was unmotivated, but I just couldn't find the time to do everything I needed to do. For instance, I'd go really deep on one particular thing - like work - and not make any progress on anything else that was important to me, like exercise. \n\nWhen I hit an all time low, I started to dive pretty deep into human motivation and why I was struggling. What I found was that goals were almost like a mental trick we could use to overcome our procrastination, and help build momentum to get shit done. \n\nI'm now multiple years into using goals and they've really worked for me, so I wanted to share a bit about my story with you. \n\n## Understanding the link between goals and procrastination\n\nI'd been on another big night out after a particularly hectic week of work, and the effects of my procrastination were staring me in the face; I hadn't exercised for months, my relationship with my partner was at an all time low, I didn't have anything to look forward to. I was depressed, and it sucked.   \n\n\nI knew what I needed to do > work on my relationships, get fit and have something to look forward to, but I just couldn't get the motivation to get started on it. I was procrastinating and finding reasons why i couldn't move forward. \n\n### The psychology of procrastination\n\nBecause I'm wired this way, I went down a pretty deep rabbit hole on procrastination. I'm definitely not a scientist, but what I found is we're all pretty basic animals, with basic animal instincts with a lemming-like desire for instant gratification and the avoidance of hardship. We're like gerbils at the feeder, pressing the food button and expecting treats every 10 seconds.  \n\n### How setting goals can combat procrastination\n\nAs part of the research into procrastination, I naturally came across goal. Turns out there's a bunch of really good research out there on how goal setting helps us overcome procrastination. A lot of it is quite scientific, so I'll summarise it. \n\nWe're all chasing dopamine hits. We typically get dopamine hits from instant gratification. However, what goal setting does is *replace* the dopamine hit. It turns out that when we set a goal - it could be lose 5lbs,  win an award, or get a pay rise - we get a dopamine hit in our brain, which is almost equivalent to the dopamine hit we were getting with instant gratification. So we're not doing without the dopamine, we're merely trading it in. And it's this dopamine hit which is the dangling carrot that drags us, kicking and screaming, toward productivity. \n\nIn pursuit of more dopamine, we can use goal setting as motivational momentum, we can begin the process. Goals create a structure of clear expectations and provide the stepping stones necessary to complete tasks. Suddenly, taking action feels not only possible but enjoyable. \n\nSo, with this summary of goal-setting, I started setting goals of my own, hoping to vanquish the hurdle of procrastination once and for all.\n\n## \n\n## Identifying the root causes of my procrastination\n\nBefore setting goals, a ton of experts recommended that it was important to understand the root of my procrastination. I hadn't done much of this introspective work before, but this is what I came up with - which I think is pretty generic, and probably true for a lot of people. But still: \n\n### 1. Fear of failure\n\nIt turns out that I was pretty scared of failing. By not even starting a task, I conveniently protected myself from the stinging bite of disappointment. But, as the saying goes, \"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take,\" so I needed to shelf that fear. \n\n### 2. Perfectionism\n\nThe close cousin to my fear of failure. In my work life, I'd been doing pretty well. And I was looking for that sort of perfectionism elsewhere, which tbh just wasn't that important. I learned that I needed to say goodbye to the notion of perfect and instead embrace the beauty of progress. Moving in the right direction was important! \n\n### 3. Lack of motivation\n\nLast, but certainly not least, was my total lack of motivation. This seemed like a real chicken-and-egg situation: Did I procrastinate because I had no motivation, or was I unmotivated because I procrastinated? Not sure. But I needed to get over this. \n\n## \n\n## Setting effective and achievable goals\n\nNow that I had identified my procrastination excuses, it was time to weaponize my knowledge. \n\n### The SMART goal-setting framework\n\nThe SMART goal-setting framework is now pretty old and very popular. And there's a reason - by ensuring my goals were Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound, I felt like I had a clear path forward.  So that's where I started. \n\n### Setting goals in multiple categories \n\nI knew the areas of my life that needed to improve most; my relationships and fitness. While I was tempted to add in some other goals - like work and hobbies - I wanted to start small with some really important things. Also, my work and hobbies were going pretty well, so I didn't want to overload myself. But I did want to have a big reward that I could work towards if the other things were going well, so I added in an adventure goal. \n\nIf you're interested, the goals I set for myself were:   \n1. **Relationship goal**: Visit 12 new restaurants with my partner   \n2. **Fitness goal**: Run 1,000km this year  \n3. **Adventure**: Visit Italy  \n\n\nFor me these goals were exciting enough that I got a dopamine hit when I thought about achieving them, and they worked on the areas in my life I thought I needed the most help with - so I went with them. \n\n### Breaking down large tasks into smaller steps\n\nBecause these goals are pretty big and stretch over a decent amount of time, I employed the age-old technique of breaking my tasks down into smaller, manageable bites. This was the secret to tricking my brain into thinking that a three-course meal of productivity was actually just a series of delicious, bite-sized canap\u00e9s. \n\nInstead of trying to tackle the whole enchilada, I began by breaking it down. \n\n1. **Relationship goal**: This is a new restaurant every week for 12 weeks  \n2. **Fitness goal**: This is approximately 20km a week  \n3. **Adventure**: set a budget, research locations, book plane tickets, find an airbnb \n\nThis I could do.   \n\n\n### Prioritizing goals and tasks\n\nOf course, not all goals are created equal. Some are more important, more urgent, or simply take longer to complete. By ranking my goals and tasks in order of priority, I was able to approach my to-do list with laser focus and efficiency. It was like playing a productivity-themed game of Tetris, where goals and tasks fit in perfectly as they seamlessly disappeared from my list.\n\nThe most important was my relationship goal, followed by fitness, and then a big gap to adventure. \n\nFor me this meant that if I had to choose between going running and going on a date, I'd choose the date. \n\n## \n\n## Implementing strategies to stay on track\n\nI wasn't naive\u2014I knew that merely identifying and setting goals wouldn't be enough. I needed to implement strategies to stay on track. \n\n### Creating a weekly routine by putting time in my diary\n\nHaving a consistent daily routine and putting that time in my work calendar allowed me to carve out dedicated time for running, and going on date nights. I no longer had an excuse not to run or not to go on date night because it was blocked in my calendar. \n\nHaving a structured day helped me stay focused on my goals, but also not worry about working on them, because I knew I had set aside time for them. It meant I could neatly compartmentalise. \n\n### MOST IMPORTANT: Establishing accountability and support systems\n\nThis was by far the most important thing for me and I think totally underrated in terms of productivity. \n\nBy sharing my goals with my friends, I was able to get buy-in from them and it made me about 10,000% more accountable. Plus, it made it more fun as it became something we bonded over. \n\n**Relationship goal:** I shared this with my partner. They LOVED this goal, and working together to find new places to eat became a really fun thing that we both looked forward to.   \n**Fitness goal:** I found two friends who also like running, and they ended up setting the same goal to run 1000km. It was big enough that we felt proud to talk about it (rather than something like daily gym sessions which is kinda boring IMHO). And then it became competitive with a leaderboard which was super fun.   \n**Adventure goal:** I kept this one to myself, as a reward and something I could look forward to.   \n\n\nI found the camaraderie around my goals to be a step change for me in getting the things I needed to do done. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Monitoring progress and adjusting goals\n\n### Tracking accomplishments and setbacks\n\nCelebrating small triumphs and learning from setbacks was essential in staying the course. Analyzing my productivity highs and lows provided clearer insights into how I work best, which helped me create an even better plan for tackling those pesky unfinished tasks on my list.\n\nAs a result of my tracking, I ended up extending the due date on my goals. Life is unpredictable, and my goals were not a one-and-done activity. One time I got sick, another time my partner went away on travel, which meant the goals were hard to achieve. But by regularly reviewing progress and being prepared to course-correct and adapt, I was able to remain flexible. The way I adapted my goals was by extending the due date, which meant I had a bit of fat in the schedule, so I wouldn't feel totally depressed if I missed a run or a date night. \n\n### Celebrating small victories\n\nBy recognizing and commemorating my small victories, I learned to appreciate the journey towards achieving my goals.For instance, when we hit 250km - a quarter of the way to our running goal - we all went to a game together. The only catch was that we couldn't go to the game until everyone had run 250km, so it made it super fun to cheer each other on, and made it a big milestone to get to 500km, 750km and 1000km - which was a big part of my own personal reward system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Overcoming setbacks and maintaining motivation\n\nIt took a really long time to achieve these goals > almost a whole year. And there were a ton of setbacks. It also became a battle to maintain motivation at times. So this is what worked for me. \n\n### Leaning on my friends\n\nBecause I had a support system for my goals, when I didn't feel like going for a run, or was tempted to dive into work instead of going out for dinner - I'd share those feelings with my goal buddies. Without exception, they'd pile on me and give me a million good reasons why I should stick with my goals. And in every instance, I agreed with them and ended up doing what I said I would do. And never regretted it. \n\n### Staying focused on long-term goals\n\nWith my ongoing battle against procrastination, I found immense value in staying focused on my long-term goals rather than my weekly goals. The big goals - run 1000km, 12 date nights, visit Italy -s became my North Star. I would only have to envisage myself telling someone I had run 1000km, had a great relationship and had visited italy - to motivate me. Even though the goals were ambitious, it was *because* they were ambitious that they worked as motivators for me. \n\n### Cultivating a growth mindset\n\nAnd finally, a lot is made of this, but adopting a growth mindset. Embracing the notion that my abilities could be developed and nurtured unleashed a new found confidence that I could adapt! And most importantly, I could get over my procrastination.   \n\n\nI'm now multiple years into my goal journey, and couldn't think of doing it any other way.   \n\n\nAMA",

Normally I used to play sports during weekends at a club and I left because I had no motivation to go and I was feeling exhausted all the time so I'm essentially free the entire 2 days, I don't really hang out with people either because I'm just too tired to. Like I said I've had 2 entire days to study and I spent those 2 days doing essentially nothing and now it's too late and I'm not going to study because it won't matter anymore. This behavior has been going in for a couple years now and I'm just helpless, nothing works. I get 3 hours of sleep everyday because I even procrastate sleeping. I'm a fucking mess. I'm seriously thinking of seeing a psychiatrist for my issues but I really don't want to take medication. I'm both depressed and have ADHD but not on any medications, maybe those are the culprits? Any tips on how to overcome this hell? I've wasted my entire teenage years because of this torment, I'm hopeless.",

        "post": "My friend is struggling with ANTs (automatic negative thoughts) and self-doubt. Her goal is to become a professional musician, but thoughts like \"You'll never be good enough\" derail her progress and kill her motivation to practice. Unfortunately, she's created a vicious cycle where her ANTs push her to procrastinate, reinforcing her ANTs.\n\nSo, here are the three remedies that I shared with my friend.\n\n**ONE: Treat each of these thoughts as a short message from your brain.** Hold the message in your hand just as you would hold a letter you got in the mail. Is it true or just junk? Like physical mail, many thoughts are junk and should be dropped in the trash.\n\n**TWO: Live your values.** Is it possible that your ANTS are messages from your subconscious that you are not living your values? People who strive to live their values have fewer ANTs and have an easier time discarding them. (In a future post, I'll walk through the mechanics of how to live your values.)\n\n**THREE: Stop eating sugary foods.** They activate parts of the brain responsible for ANTs and trigger a blood-sugar roller coaster.\n\nFrom *You, Happier* by Daniel G. Amen\n\n>Sugar is addictive, pro-inflammatory, and associated with depression, obesity, diabetes, and dementia.\n\nAnyway, those are the strategies I shared with her.\n\nWhich strategies work for you?",

        "post": "I've been struggling with procrastination for years. When I try to do something productive longer than 5 minutes, it makes me feel overwhelmed and mentally exhausted and demotivated. This psychiatrist said that the way to get things done is to just do them, regardless of how I feel.\n\nWell if the answer is as simple as that, we wouldn't need free time. We would be able to work+sleep 16+8 hours per day 7 days per week. We would feel like shit, but oh ignore those feelings and just get the work done. But the reality is most people can't work that much, because willpower is a finite resource, you can't spend all of your time doing difficult, boring, stressful, unpleasant things. And I think for people with mental issues such as myself, working for 8 minutes might be as exhausting as 8 hours for healthy people\n\nSo what is someone with weakened willpower supposed to do? I feel like saying \"just do it\" is the same as when, you're trying to run faster than Usain Bolt but you fail because you don't have enough physical power, then someone comes and tells you that you just have to do it, regardless of how hard it is or what you feel. That won't help, our physical and mental limits are very real.\n\nI need to get things done for sure. But thats just not going to happen unless some major event changes my life. I have been struggling for years, I have received lots of advice. But no, my issue has not been solved.\n\nI feel stuck . I feel like I have to walk without having legs. Tips and tricks won't get me out of this. Therapy won't either because I've had therapy for years and all of those therapists were basically clueless in how to solve my problems. And I don't think there is a medication that makes me extremely productive either.\n\nSo what process or event has to happen in order for me to finally get out of my problems?",

        "post": "HOLY MOLY guys, for the first time in my life I finished work days before it was due and got an A in the accelerated summer coding class I took without cramming last minute before the final.\n\nI, like many, wanted to change myself into a better, more productive me and used the book Atomic Habits to start this journey. Out of the many great lines in the book, the one that stuck out was the one that the author kept drilling in-- \"You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems\"; and man, for years I have been telling myself, this semester I'm going to get straight A's, this week I'm going to finish my homework before the weekend, today I'm going to turn my assignment in before 11:59, and surprise surprise, none of that happened.\n\nAfter it was pointed out that my consistent goal setting was doing jack squat for me I decided that i'll give changing my system a try. So every day, I decided to stop making any goals, I didn't plan when to finish my homework, what grades I would aim for, or generally set any deadlines for myself. Instead, I gave myself from 12 AM to 11:59 PM to do just 3 hours of purely academic work.  \n\nwhen I first started timing myself, I didn't make those 3 hours at all, instead, I hit times ranging from 15 minutes to 2.5 hours. This was genuinely surpsing as I thought I studied much more than that but found out that most of my time was spent procrastinating on studying while stressing about how to reach my goals. After not making these 3 hours for over a week, I made an excel sheet and started actually recording my hours. For the first week, I saw numbers all over the place but not a single 3 hours on there, then one day, I hit it. I'm not sure what I did differently to be able to do it but it was exhilarating and I needed to see another 3 below it. So the next day I did it again, and again, and again. \n\nAfter doing these 3 hours of purely productive work each day, in less than a week, I ran out of homework to do, so I just read the textbook and worked on extra practice problems in order to hit those 3 hours. \n\nwithout realizing it, for the first time in my life, I was finishing work and studying without the oncoming pressure of a due date or exam, and I was doing it well. \n\nThe craziest part about this is that I didn't actually change at all. My whole life, being a procrastinator was a part of my identity and it's not realistic to expect that I would be able to change myself in weeks just because I wanted to. I was actually still procrastinating every single day, often waiting till the last possible hour I could to be able to hit those 3 hours before midnight. But procrastinating on the system still meant I got those 3 hours done each day, and man, the goals really did follow. \n\nOn the day that grades were released and I saw my A and 97% in a notoriously difficult summer class, I suddenly remembered that an A and the ability to not procrastinate was something that I was previously aiming for, but by putting 100% of my focus on my system, I didn't once have to think about them and they were accomplished anyway.",

        "title": "How Students Beat Procrastination: Time Blocking",
        "post": "Hey, friends!\n\nMy friend, Alice, is an anthropology major. As she starts her junior year, she has three goals:\n\n* Maintain a 3.7 GPA (and keep her scholarship)\n* Minimize studying time\n* Quiet that nagging feeling that she should be studying\n\nGetting good grades seems to be at odds with minimizing studying time. But Alice feels confident she\u2019ll achieve her goals with time blocking. (She stole this idea from Cal Newport.)\n\nAlice breaks her day into 1-hour chunks for studying, going to class, etc.\n\n## Example schedule\n\nAlice\u2019s Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule is as follows:\n\n6:00 am - study\n\n7:00 am - study\n\n8:00 am - breakfast and getting ready\n\n9:00 am - study\n\n10:00 am - class\n\n11:00 am - class\n\n12:00 pm - lunch\n\n1:00 pm - class\n\n2:00 pm - free time\n\n3:00 pm - job\n\n4:00 pm - job\n\n5:00 pm - job\n\n6:00 pm - dinner\n\n7:00 pm - free time\n\n8:00 pm - free time\n\n9:00 pm - free time\n\n(Alice sleeps from 10 pm - 6 am.)\n\n## Benefits\n\nLet\u2019s look at how time blocking helps Alice achieve her goals.\n\n**Goal 1: Maintain a 3.7 GPA (and keep her scholarship).** Time blocking ensures that Alice spends enough time studying so she\u2019s always prepared for exams. She even gets feedback on research papers\u2014and revises them\u2014before turning them in. As a result, Alice got straight A\u2019s last semester.\n\n**Goal 2: Minimize studying time.** Alice studies first thing in the morning when her energy levels are highest. Because she gets enough sleep, Alice\u2019s studying time is wildly productive, and she spends less time studying than her classmates.\n\n**Goal 3: Quiet that nagging feeling that she should be studying.** Every time Alice completes her morning study session, she feels a sense of accomplishment. Every time she walks into an exam, she feels confident and prepared.\n\nAlice feels confident she\u2019ll maintain her GPA, keep her scholarship, and graduate in four years. Consequently, Alice feels less stress and anxiety than her classmates. She enjoys her free time (watching foreign films with friends) without that persistent feeling, \u201cYou should be studying.\u201d\n\n## Downsides\n\nTime blocking has a downside that proponents seldom talk about: We give up some freedom. We can\u2019t stay up late, sleep late, and avoid studying until we feel like it. This is hard for our ego (it expects to do whatever it wants).\n\nWhen Alice adopted time blocking, it took her a couple of months to adjust. It took time to adapt to these guardrails. The hardest part was when Alice had to limit time with a close friend. (The friend stayed out late, procrastinated, and pulled all-nighters). This chaotic lifestyle was incompatible with Alice\u2019s desire to maintain her grades and lower her stress.\n\nAlice misses her friend. She misses watching midnight movies and talking until dawn. But she doesn\u2019t miss the anxiety that accompanies a chaotic life. She doesn\u2019t miss studying late, turning in barely-finished papers, and always feeling exhausted.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t miss feeling out of control.\n\n(In the months since switching to time blocking, Alice made two new friends. They share her love of foreign cinema, and their lifestyles more closely align with Alice\u2019s.)\n\n## Trade-offs\n\nTime blocking comes with trade-offs. We give up some freedom, but we get better sleep and better grades. We boost productivity and reduce stress.\n\nFor some people, this isn\u2019t worth it. For them, time blocking is a prison. They prioritize freedom and despise schedules. (If this is you, that\u2019s OK.)\n\nIn the end, each of us decides how to structure our life. Each of us decides what\u2019s important.\n\nBut if you want to increase productivity and decrease stress, try time blocking. Try setting clear boundaries for studying, sleeping, and recreation.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll love it. And you\u2019ll never go back.",

        "post": "If you find that you're wasting too much time on things like YouTube or games or Reddit, then you're probably feeling pretty frustrated with yourself at this point. Perhaps you've been trying for a long time to get these habits under control with little success so far.\n\nImportantly: It's not useful to just say \"I need to stop being on my phone so much!\"\n\nInstead, in order to eliminate procrastination, you need to get it at the *root*.\n\nYou get to the root by understanding how procrastination works. So let's get into that now:\n\n# Why you procrastinate\n\nHere's the rule:\n\n**If you don't WANT TO do it, and if you don't HAVE TO do it... then you won't do it.**\n\nTake a second to roll that around in your head, and tell me if that's the truth or not. Have you ever done anything in your life that you neither had to do (i.e. obligation, force, coercion, persuasion etc) or wanted to do? I think the answer is no.\n\nNow take a look at literally anything that you're procrastinating on. Let's say it's some piece of work for your job or degree. It's due in a few weeks, you don't have to do it now. And also it's just not your favourite way of spending time. It's not fun.\n\nYou don't want to do it. Of course, you want *to be done* with it, but you don't want *to do* it. Important difference.\n\nSo what happens? You don't do it. Simple. But it needs to get done still, so when will you do it? ... Only when you must! Only when you simply cannot delay it any longer. And then there's this switch that flicks in you that goes into this *mad scramble* that's full of stress and terror and caffeine and no sleep. And eventually you get it done because you always knew that THIS is the exact smallest amount of time you can possibly do it in.\n\nThis is how procrastination works. Now, how to use this information to stop procrastinating?\n\n# How to stop procrastinating\n\nThis is not complicated. It can be slightly difficult at first, but it's well within your ability to do this.\n\nWe need to set up two things. First, a schedule-structure that will keep you on track, and second is to establish that you HAVE TO stick with the schedule. I'll show you how.\n\n**1. Establish Schedule-structure**\n\nWhatever it is that you need to do, put it in a schedule. So figure out when it's time to do this thing, and put it in your calendar, setting up reminders that tell you when it's time.\n\nFor your exercise plan, establish when you'll be exercising, where you'll do it, what materials you'll need, and for how long this will go on.\n\nFor your work project, break it down into pieces and establish when each piece will need to be done by in order to stay on track. Plug them into your calendar. Set time aside to do them.\n\n**2. Establish Necessity (i.e. make it so that you have to)**\n\nContinuing with the exercise example - it's difficult to convince ourselves \"I must work out today.\" Because we don't buy it. We know that we can just skip it and that it won't make such a big difference. We can easily talk ourselves out of it.\n\nSo let's you and I establish this: Is your exercise habit necessary *at all?* Don't just answer right away, take a minute with it. Do you find it truly necessary to have an exercise habit at all?\n\nIf the answer is \"yes\" then let's now ask: By when do you need your exercise habit? Again, take a minute to figure it out.\n\nIf the answer is \"Now\" or \"ASAP\" then take a second to figure out why. Do you truly believe this? Really establish why you believe this. Why is it truly necessary to have your exercise habit in place ASAP?\n\nNow here's the final piece. You can always talk to yourself into saying \"tomorrow, tomorrow, later, later\". But underneath that is this game you're playing where it's like \"How little can I possibly do, and still get the result?\" or put differently \"How much can I get away with?\" or \"How long can I get away with doing nothing?\" or \"What's the absolute minimum that I can do?\"\n\n... Why don't we stop playing that game now? This year, let's stop playing this game. It's a dumb game. It's not good. It holds us in immaturity and underaccomplishment. You're better than that. You deserve better than that.\n\nLet's start asking instead \"How good can I get? How healthy can I become? How far can I go? How much wellness can I possibly achieve in this lifetime?\" And start really asking these questions! Start really orienting yourself THIS way.\n\n# Bringing it all together (TL;DR)\n\nSo when your alarm goes off and it's time to jog, or when the day comes to finish an important piece of your project, here's what to do:\n\n\\- take yourself seriously, take your word, your *promise* seriously    \n\\- remember that you're no longer trying to get away with as little as possible, instead you're focusing on becoming as great as you can possibly be    \n\\- remember why it's important to start these habits NOW as opposed to next month    \n\\- don't get hypnotized by your own excuses, don't believe them. Instead, believe in the leadership that you're establishing now.    \n\\- Before you wouldn't do your work until you HAD TO, and that meant there was no more time. NOW you're doing it today because you HAVE TO, because you committed to doing it today.\n\n**Final Notes**\n\nTake this seriously! I know that this is just a random reddit post from a random dude, but you can literally use this to get out of this complaining, powerless state of procrastination and into actual momentum where you're actually getting your shit done.\n\nMaybe you'll still mess up along the way, but the idea isn't to \"not mess up\" it's to keep applying increasingly intelligent effort until the momentum picks up. Keep going. You really can do this.\n\n[Brent Huras](https://www.reddit.com/user/brenthuras/comments/m24ixm/consider_working_with_a_productivity_coach/)",

You MUST stick to your activity for the duration of that time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter you are done, repeat it again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKey points:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **This is not Pomodoro**\n\nNotice that the technique says nothing about productivity. Nor does it say anything about work or rest.\n\nIf you choose to play video games for an hour, that is absolutely fine.\n\nIf you choose to work out for five minutes, that is absolutely fine as well.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you choose to do push-ups or stare at the ceiling.\n\nJust pick an activity, set a timer, commit to it and go for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.  \"This doesn't help productivity at all, what if I keep procrastinating?\"**\n\nAgain, notice that it doesn't say anything about how much you get done or how much progress you make, or how good your work is. \n\nIf you decide to write a book for 10 minutes, then go for it. It doesn't matter if you write ten pages or ten letters. It doesn't matter if it's the best or the worst writing in the world.\n\nAll that matters is your intention and your commitment to your intention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \"I can't decide what I want to do!\"**\n\nThen set some time to decide what you want to do, maybe 10 minutes to plan out things you want to do. After you are done, pick a new activity, set a timer, and go for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. \"This is stressing me out, and I'm already stressed. I want to be in a free flow\"**\n\nThis is simply not true - realize that there is no difference between this and doing whatever you want apart from one: \n\nYOU are in control.\n\nThis is taking control back from procrastination, video game or series addiction, and all the other factors in your life.\n\nAnd once you do this four or five times and realize that YOU are always in control, you will feel better and you will start making better decisions. Things that overwhelmed you or that caused a lot of procrastination will become easy and manageable, simply because you know and feel that you are in charge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving no control is easy in the moment and stressful in the long run.\n\nBeing in control is stressful in the moment and easy in the long run. And then it actually becomes easy in the moment because you get used to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWish you all a productive day!",

Im lonely, and the only highlight of my life is studying. But I just cant start. I now have to practice for a subject I have absolutely 0 interest in - literature. I realized that Ill have to write like 3 essays for the practice paper and I just cant even get myself to start. I just wish I had happiness, friends and fulfillment in my life. Theres absolutely no fun. I cant drive around because im 16. I cant go for a walk or a run because I dont know the routes, and I actually got lost once. I feel like a bird trapped in a cage.

        "post": "Hi There,\n\nCome on. It's okay to admit it to yourself. Even the most remarkable \"doers\" have spots they keep pushing away from.\n\nAt least, I do.\ud83d\ude00\n\nI consider myself productive, but sometimes I struggle to attack a task that doesn't interest me at first. Two examples:\n\nI created a blog in English. There are 120 articles. I want to translate them into French (my native language). I put off the task every time because I have no attraction for the technical aspect of this project.\n\nOr else;\n\nI live abroad. Since I arrived nine years ago, I have used an external service to do my tax return. I don't like the service and waste time and energy. Every year I tell myself I will learn, figure it out and do it myself.\n\nThe problem is that I have no interest in taxes and even less in a language I don't know well.\n\nI\u2019ve made progress on both projects in the last few weeks, and I see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n# 4 surprising things I've (re)learned.\n\n**1. Start small:** Take one tiny action and start it. What do you risk? Nothing. Either it gives you an appetite and you move on to the next ones. Or you stop there and at least you've started.\n\n**2. Discover hidden pleasures.** A project requires a multitude of tasks. Even if you don't like the overall subject, there will be things you enjoy doing. Start there.\n\nI don't like the technical project around translation. But I enjoy evaluating the different options and reading the experiences of others.\n\nOr I don't like taxation, but I like to research, learn, exchange with people who can help me.\n\n**3. Once you get started, don't space out your actions too much.**\n\nI had started a few months ago ( just do it) the research activities for the blog translation, and I stopped everything. When I recently wanted to start again. It took me a long time to pick up where I left off. When you start, keep going. Even if it's a little each time. Relearning takes a lot of time.\n\n**4. Surf on that feeling of success.** You did something you didn't like to do. You have a strong sense of accomplishment. Use it to tackle another project you've been putting off.\n\nAnd remember.\n\nStart rolling the ball and don't let it stop.\n\nGo for it, and accomplish even the projects that paralyze you the most.  \nThank you.",

And I absolutely love reading non-fictional books, especially about psychology, personal development, business and random books about random facts. Besides that, for a few years now I started to invest in the local stock market.  And now I started to learn programming again, mostly as a hobby, but don't exclude the possibility of a career change.\n\nI really like doing everything listed above, but I dread doing them, or more exactly, starting that. Even reading, I have to push myself to do it. But I absolutely love it. \n\nI thought about it and I think it might be due to the lack of endorphins I get doing the things above, but that I get while mindlessly browsing Youtube. My brain might be too fixed in the instant-gratification that I receive usually that makes me sick at the thought of doing something productive, even though I totally enjoy that activity.\n\nIs this a valid hypothesis? Are there any tips on how I can help me overcome this dread and procrastination? I am thinking of quitting social media for a few weeks and maybe keep Youtube only as a 30 minute reward after I do something productive, but I fear that might not be the sole culprit.",

        "post": "Everybody thinks that procrastination is a serious impediment to one's life. And almost all guidebooks recommend techniques to avoid procrastination. And most of the users of these techniques\u00a0**end up frustrated**\u00a0because they fail to get rid of their procrastination after all.\n\nBut there is an intelligent solution for dealing with procrastination, which is even a great opportunity for your life goals and which was\u00a0**a game changer for me**, after I started to use it some years ago. It's not a solution for every case, but for many people.\n\nThe mechanisms of our psyche come to our aid here. Because in order to procrastinate, we need an excuse for our conscience. Therefore, we do other things instead of the planned task. And we then have a strong motivation to do these other things, precisely because we are happy to have found an excuse with them.\n\n**Use that motivation -- we only have to follow one rule for this:**\u00a0When procrastinating, do not under any circumstances do things like vacuuming the house or other things that are not important, as a substitute action. Only dedicate yourself to tasks that are important for shaping your future, but for which you otherwise never find the time. Now, when procrastinating, you have the time!\n\nThat is the much bigger impediment to our positive future design compared to procrastination: most of us are caught up in an overwhelming number of things that have to be done, that are quite urgent at some point, so that we almost never get around to taking care of the really important things. These are things that move us forward in life, but they are never urgent. That's why they often never get done, and that's why so many people don't achieve their goals in life.\n\n**So what\u2019s the advice here?**\u00a0Let procrastination happen! But only allow doing an important task towards achieving your life goals, as a substitute action. Procrastination is the chance to finally find time and motivation for the really important things in life!",

People underestimate ADHD and procrastination, but it's something that can destroy our lives and even cause us to die.\n\nI was fired from my job because I didn't do the things I needed to do, and I was constantly procrastinate, and I was unemployed for a long time because I was too lazy to look for a job. I was alone because I was procrastinate to talk and meet my friends. Even with my girlfriend, I broke down because of procrastination, and maybe now I can have a happy family, but I am alone, and procrastination is the culprit of all of this. I can't do anything I need to do.\n\nI KNEW THE THINGS I HAD TO DO AND I WANTED TO DO THEM, BUT I COULDN'T. ALL THE PEOPLE WERE BLAMING ME AND I HATED IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON WHO UNDERSTOOD AND HELPED ME.\n\nI can't do anything, but I feel like I have to do something and I'm stuck in anxiety. When it's too late, I feel stupid and useless, and I have irreversible regrets. Procrastination torments my soul and I suffer every second of my life. The final straw was that I nearly died from procrastination.\n\nI also tried many ways to get rid of procrastination, including medication, but failed. I discovered the accountability partnership. I don't have a friend to partner with me, even if I did, I would feel like a burden to him or I would be ashamed to talk about my simple silly things, and I couldn't do it all the time. I needed an accountability partner who would always accompany me, I would not be ashamed and I would not feel bad. So I met a guy who offers an accountability partnership service.\n\nHe taught me how to create a routine, how to stick to it, how to do the things I need to do without procrastinating, and he followed my progress every day. I talk to him every day and talk about my progress.\n\nAt first I had doubts in my mind, I didn't know if the accountability partnership would work and I did it reluctantly. But now I'm glad I met him.\n\nHe also understands and helps me because he has ADHD. I'm not ashamed of him or feel like I'm a burden to him. He doesn't talk about things that don't work because he applies what he told me to in his own life.\n\nThanks to him, if there are 10 things I have to do, I can easily do 8 of them, and I can handle the remaining 2 things in that day. I used to be unable to do any of them and flounder in the pit of procrastination. You need an accountability partner because you are like me.\n\nYou have a life worth living, and procrastination is preventing you from living your life. Beat procrastination at all costs.",

        "post": "\\*spent 6 years procrastinating my way through life with raging ADHD\\*\n\n\\*this is a combo of trial and error/ 4 day work week / and some guys point system idea\\*\n\n\\*Trust me read this give it a shot you have nothing to lose\\*\n\n# THE GAME\n\n* Points based system for completed tasks with a set requirement of points for each type of day\n* A \"pot\" of points for points over the daily target that can be \"spent\" on \"rest days\" or deducted from for failing to meet the days point quota\n* Centres around \"deep work blocs\" and \"shallow work blocs\" as well as other aspects of a routine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Task Points**\n\n* The basics of work related points system\n\n|Deep work bloc|2 Points|90 minute intense undistracted bloc with a set goal beforehand that must be completed by the end of the 90 mins /must be seated at a table / 5 minute focus breathwork beforehand|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Shallow Work bloc|1 point|60 minute bloc of more menial admin tasks that dont require much thought like emails, reading, learning, spanish lesson etc can be done in bed|\n\n* Non work related point system\n\n|Morning routine|1 point|Waking at certain time / taking meds / making bed / meditation|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Night routine|1 point|No phone / skincare / review day / bedtime|\n|Gym|1 point|Either gym / running / muay thai|\n|Meal prep|1 point|Meal prepping for gym or cooking new food, your diet is so much more important than you'd think for your focus|\n\n* This is just a few i have in the game and can be adapted to whatever your goals are the harder the task the more points but also be realistic with it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DAY GOALS**\n\n* Point goals for each kind of day\n\n|**Clear Day**|8  points|A day with nothing else on there is motivation to gain some points in pot|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Sick Day**|**4 points**|Performing low but option for shallow reading work or watching youtube tutorials there to prevent pot loss|\n|**Hungover Day**|5 points|write off the morning and midday potential for post hangover regret to produce a lot of points to the pot|\n|Social Day|4 points|Get a routine in or 1 deep bloc in if i can usually lose some points on this day but thats ok cause im doing things with people not sitting on my ass|\n|\\--------------------------------------------|\\------------------------------------------|\\------------------------------------------|\n|Rest day|COSTS  5 POINTS|Tactically pick these days any points from habits like morning routine dont count so either brutal hangovers or holidays or days where im just not feeling up for it usually have 1 a week with still a consistent saving of points for any upcoming holidays etc|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE POT**\n\n* As mentioned the pot is like a points bank that can be added to when i exceed the target, deducted when i underachieve in a day or spent on rest days\n* You shouldnt be finding yourself in pot debt often, if you are consider lowering daily targets you can always make it harder but if its too hard at the start you wont stick with it, its about rewarding not punishing\n\n\\*If you find yourself having given up or taking out an unqualified pot loan on a weeks long coked out miami trip then give yourself a Pot Bailout\n\n**Pot bailout**\n\n* Pot balance goes to 0\n* It halves the points tally for the next week\n* this tricks your mind and incentivises it to harvest some sweet points at half the effort and is far more effective at getting you back in the game than the ill start again tomorrow mentality\n* If you find yourself bailing yourself out a lot or think this would be abused by you then feel free to add a punishment or eliminate the bailout altogether\n* just do whatever will make you want to stick with it, the game gives your brain little dopamine hits it is unlike any other boring productivity programme trust me give yourself a week or 2 at this and your brain will grow addicted\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key points**\n\n* To prevent burnout i have a max limit on 2 deep work blocs per day and 2 shallow work blocs per day\n* Dont make it too hard to only barely hit your daily target you should generally be able to bank about 1 or 2 points a day the main points are made due to having non clear days meaning the points addiction in your head will be more inclined to want to socialise rather than grinding clear days for a day of rest sitting by yourself\n* Also dont make it too easy or try to Top G your way to 50 points a day in hopes to buy a lambo with your pot, the rewards system is there to develop a sustainable and realistic daily goal without relying on outside motivation.\n* Consistency and motivation are completely different this game breeds consistency that works, the grind mentality motivational hustle is not effective in the long term and you will either burn out or not start\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\***The Importance of Switching off\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n* To develop the \"**on/off switch**\" for focus on your brain it is vital that you relax and do not stress or work outside of blocs\n* you might feel motivated and zoned to do more blocs but it is not sustainable and counterproductive to the game\n* being able to have the satisfaction of stopping knowing youve completed a bloc and moving on develops that mental switch and makes it easier to switch into the zone\n* Having an open ended relationship with work where your sort of done but could do more but are now distracted and procrastinating while thinking of work is the **EXACT** trigger point for failed systems and poor productivity\n* When done reward yourself by doing what you like to do normally guilt free be that games or netflix etc it will establish a much better relationship between your minds views on pleasure and work\n* However maybe try new relaxing hobbies or skill based relaxation like learning to draw or playing guitar rather than porn or harassing people online\n* I have an off switch goal of having a convo with a random person every day or getting outside to a social event when i can for 1 point but that's just me you can implement whatever personal goals into a trackable progressive growth hobby with the game\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***THIS IS JUST MY VERSION START WITH JUST THE WORK BLOCKS AND ADD OR SUBTRACT WHATEVER FITS YOUR LIFESTYLE THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE  :)***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny feedback be that criticism or reviews on how you have got on with or adapted the game into your life would be very well received.\n\nI wish yous all the best whether you give this a try or not happy new year my dudes lets get after it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit--- post was taken down for a few hours because of shilling to be clear i am not shilling or asking for any course sign ups i just thought id post something that worked for me in hopes it works for you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR  --   in actual practice this is what it looks like, this is my whiteboard for today ===\n\npot =7 (my pot total is 7)\n\nday type = clear 8 (i had nothing else on today so i have a target of 8 points)\n\nPoints = 9 (2 deep blocs 2 shallow blocs 2 routines and a meal prep)\n\ni hit my goal and have added 1 point to my pot so it goes up from 7 to 8\n\ni then rub everything

        "post": "You probably clicked on this \"guide\" with hesitation, expecting to read some variation of \"Just Do The Thing!\" Just the act of reading those words fills me with guilt and makes me feel like a lazy asshole and a burden to society, to put it mildly. Well, this is not a guide, this is more of a personal anecdote from a prolific procrastinator. I'm not going to tell you to Just Do It, but maybe you'll see yourself in me and learn from my ongoing journey with procrastination.\n\n\nHere's my credentials as a procrastinator:\n\n* I get violent diarrhea every time I begin to do The Task\n* I've avoided my professors for months at a time\n* Been in university for nearly 9 years\n* I got a passing grade on my final project for my Bachelor's degree out of pure pity\n* Lost my work from home job because I couldn't start, let alone, finish projects\n* Require constant supervision or I'm not going to get anything done\n\n\nDoes any of that sound familiar?\n\n\n\nI'm no psychologist, so I see procrastination through a much too simple lens:\n\n\nI have The Task I must do => Thinking of doing The Task makes me feel unwell => I do things to distract myself from feeling unwell\n\n\nThen it becomes a vicious cycle. I lost time, so now I have to do The Task **even harder**, thinking of the task makes me feel **even shittier** and after a few cycles I've create some unhealthy fixations on the potent forms of escape.\n\n\n\nHow the hell do you get out of the cycle? The normal advice is what we've all read many times over before. Just Do The Thing! As if I've never thought of that? This advice comes in lots of variations. For instance, in my brief stint of therapy my Doctor told me to make a schedule, and then Just Do It. For me, the schedule was just another brick on top of that ominous dark tower that I needed to run far away from. When I tried this advice, I was filled with dread as the minutes, and then seconds started to creep nearer to the start of The Task's allocated time. The feeling built up and I'm sad to admit that the ecstasy of relief was absolutely tremendous when I booted up my favourite video game instead of doing the task.\n\n\n\nSo maybe Just Doing It isn't the answer for everybody. It's certainly not for me. Let me offer an alternative. What if I told you...\n\n\nI Was Already Doing It? Hear me out, if I'm escaping from my thoughts, that necessarily means that I'm thinking about the task. Planning and thinking ahead *is* a fundamental part of doing a task. Ergo, by worrying about the task, I'm doing the task. I find this approach is gentle to my feeling of self worth. When you worry about your task, you're thinking of future repercussions and how much of a failure it's going to be, yeah? That's *planning* right there!\n\n\n\nHow do I embrace this mentality? So I figured out that this silent panic, this building dread I get when I need to do something, is not something I should strive to remove, but something I can feel positive about. I did this by tracking those 30 minutes in bed every morning worrying about my task, unable to get up, *as if I were at my desk actively working on it.* Luckily, my partner got me into bullet journals a while ago. So to track the time spent towards my task I simply tally some representative lines for those 30 minutes next to the day's entry of *university project*. Even though it's just 30 minutes out of the thousand hours I need for my project, it feels good to acknowledge that I am working towards it and giving it attention. But that was just one piece of the puzzle, the other missing piece was ...\n\n\n\nNo Black Holes Until X O'Clock. I'm the kind of guy who likes to start the day nice and slow. Grab a cup of coffee and surf reddit for a bit to start the day. My escapes are like a black hole for me. I let myself enjoy them for just a moment and the whole day flies right past me. I've become so good at procrastinating that I'm quite unable to think about The Task at all when I'm distracting myself. Clearly, that is a problem. My solution was not to allocate time to The Task, but instead to ban myself from my Black Hole activities until a certain time of day had passed. To start, I set the goal of 3 PM. I wouldn't play video games or Reddit until then.\n\nThis does not mean I'm working on my task from the moment I wake up until the clock strikes 3 PM. I have a routine in the morning, I take my time preparing breakfast and I do some light cardio and make myself some lunch. The point is not that I have to be working on The Task, I simply have to avoid the Black Holes. The trick is being able to embrace boredom. Sometimes you cannot muster the courage to do The Task, and even then, you must refrain from escaping. Boredom is bliss. By the time my daily \"Black Hole ban\" is lifted, I feel that same ecstasy as when I was cheating my therapist's time schedule. Only this time I'm in control.\n\n\n\nIt started with worry, then boredom when the stimulation from my favourite activities weren't available. Then I started worrying some more. I wrote down my fears and projections for the future, it's not that much extra work. What exactly could I be doing, one tiny step in the right direction? Write that down too. The anxiety and feelings of worry turned into actionable thoughts. It took me a few days, but I eventually I sat down and got stuff done. I've got a long road ahead of me, but I feel like I'm finally getting somewhere.\n\n\n\nSo now, at the end, let me share the beginning of my success with you.\n\nTime spent working on my task in a typical week of last December: 2-4 hours.\n\nTime spent working on my task just today, when I hadn't even made plans on doing anything: 5 hours.",

        "post": "This might sound like a New Age kind of advice, but it is psychology 101. Procrastination, like many other unwanted emotional states, does not come about suddenly or by accident. Something led to the moment when you chose procrastination before a more pressing/meaningful activity. Getting mad with yourself at that moment - paradoxically - only enforces it.\n\nAnger, just like sadness or giving in shows the person they are helpless against something. You are not helpless against procrastination but you cannot emotionally whip yourself out of it (at least not in a sustainable manner).\n\nThe same goes for compulsively trying to figure out when and why did you start procrastinating - these are in part valid questions, but answers often do not help like in the movies when you have a cathartic moment that suddenly frees you from some emotional burden.\n\nInstead, you can try noticing when you start to waste time and accepting that you are, at that moment, procrastinating. Try to do the same without any negative implication, like saying you're crazy, lazy, stupid or anything like that.\n\nWhile the process might sound like doing nothing, it can put you on a (long and demanding) road to overcoming procrastination.  \n\n\nEdit -  Thank you so much for reading and upvoting, the post is getting a lot of traction!

        "post": "Hello friends,\n\nI decided to make this post to get a few things off my chest that I haven\u2019t told anyone. I\u2019m not sure if this is my ADHD-PI symptoms taking over my life or if I\u2019m just lazy. I\u2019ll start with some background on me - \nI always considered myself intelligent when growing up. I tested \u201cgifted\u201d at a young age and always did very well on tests (including notoriously unreliable IQ tests). I was that kid in school who\u2019s teachers always said things like \u201che\u2019s very smart, but why doesn\u2019t he ever turn in the assignments/do the work/study?\u201d They (and myself) were convinced I was just lazy. It felt like I didn\u2019t have the capacity to care enough to do any work. It felt impossible to care, impossible to sit down and put pen to paper. \n\nWhen I started college, I failed every single class my entire first two semesters. Something about the lack of structure made all of it even more impossible feeling. Mind you, this is when my OCD was at its worst as well, which can probably be blamed for a good portion of my troubles in that time. After one more semester of terrible performance, I was put on academic probation. This was like a wake up call to me. It was like now that I saw a real punishment and real consequence of my actions, I knew I had to try as hard as I could to get back in good standing. For the next two years, I never got a grade below an A. It was like I found my motivation in beating everyone else on tests/assignments. It motivated me greatly and I felt on top of the world because I felt like I was finally living up to my potential. Unfortunately this was all temporary and my last year of college I slacked quite a bit and coasted. But hey, in my eyes I had earned it.\n\nNow comes the part that I\u2019ve never told anyone. In my 7 years in the working world, I\u2019ve probably managed to do about 2 years of actual work, at best. I work as a computer scientist and my deadlines are fairly ambiguous, so I\u2019ve always been able to push deadlines and procrastinate (relatively) undetected. I say relatively because I have never been explicitly disciplined for it, but it has no doubt affected relationships with coworkers and superiors. I even started a new job recently thinking it would give me a fresh start and working on new projects would motivate me to get things done. Wrong. It\u2019s been about a month and a half and I\u2019m quickly sinking into the depths of inadequacy.\n\nWhy am I writing this now? After browsing this sub I finally feel less alone and I\u2019m hoping someone else has a similar experience, maybe even some idea as to how I can get better. I fear it will take a drastic disciplinary action to get me back on track, as that\u2019s what it took in the past. The sad part is simply acknowledging that me being fired is a possibility doesn\u2019t even motivate me to be better. I\u2019m stuck. Stuck in this sad, vicious cycle: \n\n\u201cI should get started on project Y\u201d\n\n\u201cNot today though, I\u2019ll definitely start it tomorrow.\u201d\n\n*Extreme anxiety because I realize I\u2019ll never change*\n\nRepeat. Repeat a thousand times.\n\nI\u2019m desperate to make a change and be better, but I just can\u2019t seem to want it bad enough. Can\u2019t fathom starting a fight with my executive dysfunction and being victorious.\n\nIf anyone made it this far, thank you so much for listening. Any help/advice is appreciated as I\u2019m not even sure anymore if it\u2019s my ADHD controlling my life or if I\u2019m truly just lazy.",

        "post": "Many of us struggle with smartphone addiction.\n\nThe first step to beating phone addiction is not to get a dumb phone, delete all your social media apps, or lock your phone during work hours. Granted, these can be useful strategies, but they're not where we start.\n\nInstead, we start by discovering the problems that our smartphones solve for us.\n\nFor example, some of us have fidgety hands and need something to do while watching TV or listening to a lecture. So scrolling through Twitter gives our hands something to do. Scrolling through Twitter solves a problem.\n\nWe overcome our phone addiction by finding better ways to solve our problems. For example, while we watch TV, we might keep our hands busy by drawing, crocheting, or folding paper. We might try doodling, knitting, are playing with a fidget toy.\n\nOnce we find better ways to solve our problems, our phones lose much of their appeal.\n\nBut what problems do smartphones help us solve?\n\nHere are the problems I've identified:\n\nA) I have fidgety hands, and they need something to do.\n\nB) I feel lonely, so social media keeps me company\n\nC) I want to stay up to date with my friends and family\n\nD) I want to stay up-to-date with world news, politics, and current events\n\nE) I don't feel like my life has much meaning or purpose, so my phone helps fill the void\n\nF) I'm procrastinating on assignments, and I want to take my mind off the fact that I'm procrastinating\n\nG) I strongly dislike boredom, and my phone serves me limitless novelty. What else am I gonna do while waiting in a grocery line or sitting on the toilet?\n\nH) I feel sad, depressed, and/or angry, and my phone helps soothe these negative emotions.\n\nI) I like background noise because it's motivating and/or makes me feel less alone, so I end up turning on YouTube or TikTok\n\nJ) I've built up a tolerance (and expectation) for highly stimulating media. I need a steady dose of stimulation just to feel OK. Activities with low stimulation (reading a physical book) are boring.\n\nK) I'm stuck in a negative loop, where I waste time on my phone, feel bad about myself, and then self-soothe by wasting more time on my phone.\n\nL) I have low confidence and self-esteem, so I comfort myself with distractions\n\nM) I use my phone as an alarm in the morning, so I end up getting sucked into social media every morning\n\nN) I feel despair and dread about my future and the future of our world, so numbing myself with social media seems like the only sensible thing to do\n\nO) I need someone to care for, and I need to feel needed. And people online are the only ones who seem to need and appreciate me.\n\nOK, so these are the problems I've identified.\n\nDid I miss any?\n\nDo any of these resonate with you?\n\nEDIT: I'm adding these items based on the comments\n\nP) I feel overwhelmed by things that I can't control\n\nQ) I'm sitting on the toilet with nothing else to do\n\nR) I'm stuck in a loop of asking questions and using my phone to look up the answers. Every new answer is a form of novelty and stimulates my mind.",

But I realized that I need to embrace uncomfortable situations to get where I need to be, but I tend to avoid on purpose despite the realizing this problem and I try to do a quick google search and I learned that maybe this could be a cause of executive dysfunction and I just feel like this is becoming a problem in my life that is affecting badly because life isn't easy and brain wants it easy. So it's like how do you come up with a solution?\nI've been telling myself since last week that I'm going to contact my college advisor just to talk about my academics because I just want to get some clarity and that's one of my problem is like why am I trying to be a perfectanist or avoiding making mistakes because the fear of regrets, failures, setbacks. So every day I worry all day long about my problems but I just don't do it. And instead I'm doing random stuff like scrolling on the phone or doing things around the house. But every time I try to do something that requires action is just my brain just shuts off and I just feel like a complete confusion.",

Been falling extremely behind in academics and hobbies that it's had a heavy toll on my relationships, personal development, and self-esteem.

Whether it being glued to bed skimming through old books. or losing hours playing key-only videogames; the habit is so deeply-rooted  in me that I inevitably work around any barrier or enforcement I set for myself.\n\nWith effort, I've gone nowhere.

        "post": " \n\nI've  always been lazy, of sorts. I used to lean into the role of \"I'm just  enjoying life\" by being lazy, doing only fun stuff. When I was younger  it was fun, no one was bothered, and it had little repercussions. Now,  at 39, I have periods where this attitude (?) picks up again, and it's  utterly destroying my career, and with it, my self-worth and my everyday  wellbeing.\n\nCurrently I'm facing a deadline, and I *cannot*,  for the $$$$ing life of me, get the work done. I'll sit and watch a  blank wall if I have to (or post on reddit if it'll give me the  impression I'm making progress). I've gone through this time and time  again. All the tips of \"just start\", \"just 10mins\" really don't do it  for me. I'm pretty cerebral and I overthink things, and I think I need  to understand how this thing functions and how it affects me in order to  beat it, or hack it.\n\nI love  reading and I love learning from books. There's a lot out there on  procrastination, and I'm also thinking self-discipline is worth looking  into. But the self-help industry is full of utter garbage on the one  hand, and a lot of semi-academic work that looks into the how, but less  into actionable tips and tricks.\n\nIs  there any reading you would recommend that takes a practical approach  to this subject? Maybe even a blog post you'd recommend or a newspaper  article?\n\nThanks.",

I've realized how much of my life I have wasted consuming completely useless media such as youtube, tiktok, etc. I think I have a proper addiction to it and although I've been able to cut out everything else for the past year and a half, I have just replaced it with watching youtube and randomly browsing other things. I've realized that because of this my procrastination is horrible and I get into this horrible cycle of putting things off to watch youtube or do something on the internet, and then feeling guilty and staying up to finish the work I need to get done and I end up not spending time with family or friends, or even going out at all.\n\nThe catalyzing factor that made me notice this actually is how all of my friends are in relationships, and while I know that's not something I should judge myself for, I know for a fact that the reason why I haven't been able to be in a relationship is because of my lack of organization in life that would allow me to go out and mingle. I am so incredibly lonely and I have no idea how to stop so that I would feel like there is actual meaning to my life instead of just having it bloated with useless content. \n\nTL;DR: my internet addiction is ruining me emotionally, socially, academically, physically and mentally, and I have no idea how to stop myself.

        "post": "A great trick I use when I get unfocused (writer and business owner) is to channel any unfocused/procrastinating time - reddit, fb, instagram, youtube, etc etc etc - into cleaning the house. Hear me out.\n\nNot only does this train your mind to take a negative behavior and turn it into something productive, but it gets you up and away from your screen and into something physical. I would bet that most of the time when we're fidgety and unfocused, we need to get into our bodies. \n\nBreak up the chores into smaller tasks throughout the day, or hit it hard like a workout at the gym. You can choose a 30-minute household chore break and clean the bathroom, or take a full hour and get the vacuuming done.  Either way, at the end of the day, the time you would have spent surfing the web will have been repurposed, resulting in a shiny clean dwelling you can enjoy and feel proud of.\n\nAnother benefit: when I do this, it changes my attitude about work. Instead of dreading it or feeling like it is my \"big task\" of the day, I now see sitting down with my laptop and a cup of tea as a wonderful reprieve from all of that physical labor - I even see it as a reward. So, in essence, I tricked my mind.\n\nBy tossing myself into a completely different, beneficial, productive and somewhat humbling activity, I've reset my attitude and can look at my work differently, and with gratitude. This generates a lot of creative and productive energy for me. \n\n: )\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post": "I'm trying to end my social media addiction. It keeps railroading me in unexpected ways.\n\nI am 24 and over the last few months my social media addiction got horrible. I'd scroll instagram for hours on end and would also spent entire days doing nothing but lying in bed doom-scrolling through Instagram. It also makes me deeply anxious because of all the comparison social media brings so I decided to quit it entirely a few weeks ago. I deleted instagram. Deleted facebook too for good measure. \n\nI didn't want to completely disconnect myself so I downloaded reddit and carefully re-curated my feed according to the things I want to pursue. So far reddit has worked fine because it's so dull most days that I barely spend a collective total of one hour on it per day. \n\nInstagram was my biggest problem. The first few days after quitting were really hard. Felt like I was being drained of life. But now I feel much better and don't have an urge to go back. On the other hand, I got on Netflix and started a couple of shows, and I've been on a heavy binge since then. 8-10 episodes per day on average. \n\nI wanted to cut my addiction because I was using it to avoid big tasks I had to accomplish. Like write my personal statement for the MS scholarship I'm hoping to get, apply for new jobs, invest time into learning the languages I'm working on, and working out. I procrastinate heavily when the task at hand feels scary. So I wanted to cut social media for that but instead I've just replaced with netflix. \n\nI'm thinking I'll cut netflix out too but I absolutely DREAD the feeling of being in a position where I have nothing to do but tackle the monster in front of me, and not have anything to save (or distract) me from it. That feeling of being trapped with the task at hand is scary as hell.\n\nWhen I cold-turkey Netflix, how do I make the isolation more bearable for me? And how do I make sure I don't end up being a sorry mess of misery while I try to get through the work I have been putting off? Thank you for taking the time out to read.

        "post": "   \nhuman procrastination is considered a complex psychological behavior because of the wide variety of reasons people do it. Although often attributed to \"laziness\", research shows it is more likely to be caused by anxiety, depression, a fear of failure, or a reliance on abstract goals. \n\n Procrastination teaches you to finish a 8 hour job in 30 minutes and also to finish a 30 minute job in 8 hours\n\n  **Procrastinators, make a PHYSICAL to-do list. Carry it with you. As you mark off each item, you will experience a sense of accomplishment and feel better about yourself. Start with a small and manageable list and expand as you get better.** ( The visceral action of scratching off an item as they get done, as well as the visual aspect of seeing what was accomplished can be psychologically rewarding and addicting.)\n\n If you tend to procrastinate, tell yourself \"I'm doing it for future me\" or so that \"future me doesn't have to.\" When you complete the task thank your past self for doing it. This has helped me so much.\n\n If you\u2019re struggling with discipline or frequently procrastinate, this simple exercise may help! \n\n`5 Second Rule Stop procrastinating with the 5-second rule. The 5-second rule is basically this: If you have an instinct to act on a goal, you must physically move within 5 seconds or your brain will kill the idea. When you know you should study but do not feel like studying, apply this rule. Just count 5-4-3-2-1-GO and start studying.`  \n\n  \n\nBeing greedy in progress is one of the most typical causes of procrastination.\n\nWe intend to achieve our goal as quickly as possible by climbing a gigantic ladder that becomes more challenging for our brains every day.\n\nInstead, concentrate on forming habits by taking little everyday measures.\n\nIf you want to finish a 350-page book.\n\nStart by reading 10 pages every day, not 50 pages a day.\n\n  **What's an efficient way to overcome procrastination?** \n\n \n\n**I'll answer your question, but first I need to explain all of human civilisation in 2 minutes with the aid of a cartoon snake.**\n\nHumans like to think we're a clever lot. Yet those magnificent, mighty brains that allow us to split the atom and touch the moon *are the same stupid brains* *that can't start an assignment until the day before it's due.*\n\nWe evolved from primitive creatures, but we never quite shed ourselves of their legacy. You know the clever, rational part of your brain you think of as your human consciousness? Let's call him Albert. He lives in your brain alongside an impulsive baby reptile called Rex:\n\nYou know how you can't help but notice if a stranger is tongue-wettingly gorgeous? That's Rex, and no matter how hard you try, *you can never turn him off*. He's your instinct, your impulse, your love and your fear.\n\nWe like to think of Albert as \"our true self\" - the conscious part of our brain. He's the talking, reasoning part. When we decide to go to the gym or write that term paper, Albert made that decision. But Albert is old, easily exhausted, and *switches off all the time*.\n\nYour brain is locked in a battle of wills between a sleepy professor and an impulsive reptile with unlimited energy. You may as well hand Rex the steering wheel.\n\nRex does *listen* to Albert. Like a child, he will do a lot of what he's told, as long as he doesn't disagree too much. But if Rex desperately yearns to crash on the sofa to watch Survivor and eat Cheetos, that's what you're going to do.\n\nThe incredible ascension of mankind that surrounds us is largely possible because we've developed systems to nurture the Rex's in our brains, to subdue, soothe and subvert them.\n\nMuch of this system we call \"civilisation\". Widely available food and shelter take care of a lot. So does a system of law, and justice. Mandatory education. Entertainment. Monogamy. All of it calms Rex down for long enough for Albert to do something useful - like discover penicillin, or invent Cheetos.\n\n**Now let's look at your procrastination.**\n\nYou're making a decision with your conscious mind and wondering why you're not carrying it out. The truth is your daily decision maker - Rex - is not nearly so mature.\n\nImagine you had to constantly convince a young child to do what you wanted. For simple actions, asserting your authority might be enough. \"It's time for dinner\". *But if that child doesn't want to do something, it won't listen*. You need to cajole it:\n\n* **Forget logic**. Once you've decided to do something, logic and rationale won't help you. Your inner reptile can be placated, scared and excited. But it doesn't speak with language and cannot be reasoned with.\n* **Comfort matters.** If you're hungry, tired or depressed your baby reptile will rebel. Fail to take care of yourself, and he'll wail and scream and refuse to do a damn thing you say. *That's what he's for.* Eat, sleep and make time for fun.\n* **Nurture discipline.** Build a routine of positive and negative reinforcement. If you want a child to eat their vegetables, don't give them dessert first. Reward yourself for successes, and set up assured punishments for your failure. Classic examples include committing to a public goal, or working in a team - social pressure can influence Rex.  \n\n* **Force a start.** The most important thing you can do is *start*. Much of Rex's instincts are to avoid change, and once you begin something those instincts start to tip into your favour. With enough time, you can even convince Rex to *love* doing the things he hated. There's a reason we force kids to go to school or to try piano lessons.\n* **Bias your environment**. Rex is short sighted and not terribly bright. If he sees a Facebook icon, he'll want it. It's like showing a child the start of a cool TV program immediately before bedtime. Design your environment to be free from such distractions: sign out of instant messenger, turn off notifications, turn off email. Have separate places for work and fun, and ideally separate computers (or at least accounts).\n\nOnce you know what to look for, you'll start to recognise the patterns and control them.\n\nThere's an impulsive baby reptile in your brain, and unfortunately he has the steering wheel. If you can be a good parent to him he'll mostly do what you say, and serve you well. Just remember who's in charge.",

        "title": "My personal routine for avoiding procrastination. You are welcome to emulate it.",
        "post": "Procrastination, like every other challenging mental issue, requires a well-defined strategy in order to be tackled effectively.\n\n\nMy plan is based on years of experimentation and research that allowed me to use my brain and available resources to my advantage regardless of my working environment.\n\n\nWith the plan that I am going to suggest below, you will be able to finish important tasks effortlessly and view procrastination from a different perspective.\n\n\nWhat I mean by that?\n\n\nProcrastination is a natural human tendency. No matter what you do you can\u2019t always be in work mode. There are times where you just need to chill, do nothing or inject your brain with small doses of dopamine.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s ok. Your brain is a very sensitive organ that has a limited amount of capacity in its disposal every day. From the almost 16 hours you are awake, usually 4-5 hours and maybe even less, you are able to work in deep focus mode. What we are trying to accomplish here is to make use of these hours in order to finish your most difficult tasks.\n\n\nAnd when it comes to procrastination, procrastination is not your problem. **Your mindset is the problem.**\n\n\nProcrastination should be perceived as the reward for your hard work. When you finish your important tasks, you can allow yourself to procrastinate non-judgmentally, and that is a very liberating feeling.\n\nSo, now that we have clarified the awareness part in our procrastination predicament it is time to concentrate on the action part.\n\nI will explain my personal strategy, which works extremely well, and I have been using it almost every day.\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Efficacy**\n\nFor step 1, I want to give credit to Tim Ferriss. In an [article](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks/) published back in 2013 he suggests that successful people aren\u2019t something extraordinary. They are normal people who might lack efficiency, but they managed to find ways to maximize efficacy.\nThe way you maximize efficacy isn\u2019t rocket science. It is actually quite simple and straightforward. Efficacy is all about doing the right things. So whatever life scenario you find yourself into there is definitely one thing in your life that stands out and you consider more important than other.\n\n\nWhat you need to do is give all your attention to this \u201cthing\u201d for 2-3 hours per day. That\u2019s it. Whether your \u201cthing\u201d is to prepare for a big exam, a big presentation, a pitch, an application, etc. dedicate 2-3 hours per day to it and you are good to go.\n\n\nIn Tim Ferriss words:\n\n\n\"Block out at 2-3 hours to focus on ONE activity for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nIn the following steps, I am going to show you how this is possible and the right steps to get the most out of these 2-3 hours.\n\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 No distractions, please**\n\n\nAnother huge parameter of the strategy is that it suggests that no distractions should be present during the work. What this means is that if you are doing your work on your computer, you should focus on the programs and websites that are relevant to your work. The rest of the programs and websites should remain closed.\n\n\nNo Facebook, no Twitter, no news sites, no email.\n\n\nSome people suggest using apps that help your stay disconnected from the Internet or allow you to access apps only relevant to your work, but I don\u2019t use them because I prefer to work simultaneously on my self-discipline.\n\n\nIf for any reason you need to interrupt your task because a meeting is scheduled or something unexpected comes up, you need to either end your task right there or inform the party who distracted you that you need to meet later. If you decide on the latter here are some important actions to take:\n\n\n* Inform the other (distracting) party that you're working on something right now.\n* Negotiate a time when you can get back to them about the distracting issue in a timely manner.\n* Schedule that follow-up immediately and add it in your calendar or your task list.\n* Call back the other party when your main task is complete and you are ready to tackle their issue.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Music is your guide to flow (optional but it works for me)**\n\nWherever you decide to work on your task, whether this is your office, your room, the library or a coffee shop, sound distractions will be constantly present.\n\nMusic can help you deal with that very effectively.\n\nSave some money and buy a great set of headphones. This is the only way you can experience good sound quality and let the music be your guide to flow.\n\nI strongly suggest listening to music with no vocals because vocals can be distracting. I usually prefer electronic music but if this is not your thing, melodic jazz, classical music or ambient are also great alternatives.\n\n\n**Step 4 - Start small and build up momentum**\n\n\nThe most difficult part of every task is the first minutes. It is the time where you face your creative block and resistance is raising a huge wall between you and your desired outcome.\n\n\nThe thing, however, is that you can\u2019t expect your brain to enter flow immediately. You need to provide it with some small bites of information relevant to your task in order to process that information and consequently help you get immersed in the activity.\n\n\nI am a blogger and when I start writing I feel like a crippled person. The words won\u2019t come out, whatever I write makes no sense, my grammar and sentence structure sucks. After 10-15 minutes, however, everything is formed naturally and I enjoy the writing process a lot.\n\n\nSo, whatever your task is, start small, allow yourself to produce a not-so-special result and once you enter flow you will create extraordinary ones.\n\n\n**Step 5 - Enter Flow**\n\n\nIt usually takes 10-15 minutes to enter flow. Once you are there, everything you do happens naturally, non-judgmentally and with a great sense of self-worth.\n\n\nHave you ever wondered why this happens, though?\n\nBrain imaging shows that when in flow states we often actually switch off the part of the brain that gives us our \u2018sense of self\u2019 and the part that regulates our brain function. This part is called dorsolateral frontal cortex. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is the part of our brain that allows us to analyze and question our own behavior, which can be highly useful. Unfortunately, it also slows everything down because it means that all our decisions have to go through it, and it can act as a \u201ccreative barrier.\u201d\n\n\nBy switching off this part, we allow all our attention to go to the part we want to use without censorship or micromanagement. This results in quick reactions and uninterrupted productivity.\n\n\nFlow state has fluctuations but once you are there you are actually aware of it and can become consciously productive. Because it is quite an energy draining state, however, we can\u2019t stay there long so reaching it for small time frames during these 2-3 hours can help us achieve great results.\n\nIf you liked this routine, I cover the whole topic of procrastination in one of my [articles](https://thequintessentialmind.com/overcoming-procrastination/).",

        "post": "Last week: https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/60etcz/fix_procrastination_week_1/\n\n**Week 1 Results:**\n\n~10% improvement according to recorded hours. \n\nTo recap last week, I followed 2 rules:\n\n1. Immediately do at least 15 mins of work whenever I sit down on my computer\n\n2. Only allow myself to stand up if I've been working for the last 5 mins.\n\nRule 2 was good. Surprisingly often 5 mins extended to 30 mins and also improved my mindset later.\n\nRule 1 was harder to follow. Often I got to 15 mins and immediately stopped. Sometimes, I just ignored the rule because it was daunting. Perhaps 15 mins was too long. \n\nI defined a time period as \"leisure time\" (6pm-9pm) where I ignored the rules. Bad idea. This time always put me in a bad mindset. The leisure time period should always be right at the end of the day. \n\n**Conclusion:** shorter lengths of time seem better for rules like this. Following rules is difficult and they will get broken. Likely, practicing the same rule will make it easier to follow over time. \n\n**Week 2: Road Blocks**\n\nProblem:\n\n1. When I'm making no progress, or I realise there is a huge daunting amount of work ahead of me I usually procrastinate. \n\nThis is a common problem. Your head gets heavy, you get frustrated, you justify a \"quick\" tv/games/facebook/youtube break. But you can always watch another episode. And it never puts you in the mood to do work.\n\nExercise:\n\n1. Pick an activity for your \"quick break\". Make sure it can't be done for longer than 5 mins. e.g. drink a glass of water or do 20 pushups. Don't get distracted because you're \"trying to relax\". Do those pushups and go straight back to work. \n\nI will keep following week 1 rules, but the \"sit down\" rule will be adjusted to 5 mins. \n\nWeek 3: https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/635cqh/fix_procrastination_week_3/",

        "post": "So I've always had procrastination problems, especially in this age of technology using my phone is an easy way out.\n\nMy procrastination habits before would be aiming to do 5 hours of revision and doing 3 or starting homework the night before. I would always go to the library to revise and do work because it was like my brain would go into focus mode there but at home I fall apart. \n\nThis was for my A levels (UK exams you do at age 18) \n\nThey got cancelled in March and I became quite depressed because I had worked so so hard, i wanted to redeem myself from gcse where I underperformed (due to procrastination and lack of knowing how to revise) and I was on track for top grades (A*AA) but they got taken from me. Over lockdown I built some bad habits, my screen time went through the roof and my bedtime became 2am. \n\nI went to uni in September taking these habits with me, I would usually be a bit behind on work but nothing below average. \n\nSince coming home for Christmas I've had 4 essays to write and a take home exam to prepare for the dates being:\n- essay 1 due December 14th \n- essay 2 due January 4th \n- essay 3 due January 11th\n- essay 4 due January 11th \n- exam January 18th \n\nSo I started preparing for essay 1 in November, I struggled so much trying to think of a structure etc it took up so much of my time and energy, after many meetings with my tutor I eventually thought of a structure 4 days before it was due and managed to write it, and I was happy with how it ended up. I spent a big number of hours on it.\n\nAfter that I intended on taking 2 days off before beginning research etc for essay 2, which turned into a week and then 2 weeks. Everyday I would wake up, intend on doing some work towards the essay, sit at my computer browsing emails, reddit, Facebook (I don't even like facebook), you name it, thinking \"I'll start once I've just done X\". Then I'll get hungry and have lunch etc etc, it'll get to 6pm then I'll maybe do an hour or two and then start winding down for bed (eventhough I'm still going to bed at 2am)\n\nI don't even get to enjoy my day because the essay I need to do is constantly at the back of my mind\n\nSince starting uni in September I have been going back and forth as to whether I might have ADD, just because I have always majorly struggled with procrastination when I am trying to get work done at home, especially when I have the entire day to do it. I can only properly concentrate at the library or when the thing I need to do is due very soon. I think that was why procrastination was much less of a problem for me at college because I would do 90% of my revision and work at the library, I don't get why it happens but at the library it's like my brain goes into deep focus mode, I do still get distracted but nothing like when I'm doing work at home\n\nI don't know, I was wondering if people could give me some insight on my situation? I have 2 days left to finish writing this essay, and usually the panic would be kicking in by now but it's not at all. This procrastination has been really getting me down, im not enjoying my Christmas holidays properly because of it. \n\nThanks!",

        "post": "First of all, I would like to specify that this post is coming from my perspective as a software developer, it is a bit biased but that can be ignored by replacing software terms / activities with anything else in your area of expertise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA few weeks ago, I randomly woke up at 3 am and thought of a way to organize my life each year in order to focus on personal growth and accomplishing goals. This idea came to me after reading and being inspired by Marc Andreessen\u2019s blog post from 2007 about personal productivity. It\u2019s 2017 now and I\u2019ve said to myself: \u201cWhat do I want to accomplish this year? Where will I be when 2017 is over?\u201d. Those kind of questions are really hard to come and answer if you\u2019re an avid procrastinator.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, I began scribbling a system on my old agenda that would satisfy my needs, without making me feel bad if I procrastinate and without weird habits that only screw with your brain. Here is the first draft on paper along with the final version from Evernote (there are a few words in romanian, I apologize):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Scribbling vs final list](http://csergiu.net/images/road-map-comparison.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs you can see, I\u2019ve made of list of areas where I want to see myself grow and I called it Personal Roadmap. This helped me realize that if I wanted to become better in those areas, I seriously needed to focus my time on improving them and by procrastinating I was just injecting another year of mediocrity into myself. Every time I wanted to go on Facebook or watch something useless on YouTube, I said to myself: does this help me grow and make me the person that I want to be when 2017 is over? I\u2019ve combined this thought with a nifty Chrome extension that blocks time-wasting websites called StayFocusd. After a couple of weeks of using it, I formed a habit and I don\u2019t tend to go on Facebook or YT so often anymore. Now I don\u2019t even use it anymore.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI also thought that it was okay to procrastinate here and there, as it is a normal thing and we shouldn\u2019t feel bad for doing it, it\u2019s just our brains telling us to have a break and do something mentally easy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s okay to procrastinate as long as you don\u2019t go overboard and spend the whole day doing it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe next thing I did was think in time. What do I mean by that? Well, we have 24 hours a day to do whatever we want with, so I began to calculate what I do each hour and see where I waste the most time and where I could be the most productive. This really helped put things into perspective for me. I then came up with a simple schema to visualize a usual day of my life. There were more complex versions of this but being a minimalist I\u2019ve settled on having a simple mind map.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[24h day mindmap](http://csergiu.net/images/day-mind-map.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs you can see from my schema, I am spending 10h on sleep (give or take) and 9h on work (give or take) while approximately 3h are wasted every day on commuting, doing house chores and other things of that nature.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou might wonder what procrastilearning is though, right? I know it sounds stupid but let me explain. The whole principle of my system is to ensure that I am not holding myself extremely accountable for procrastinating, otherwise it won\u2019t work because I\u2019ll always feel bad. What I did instead is, I thought of the most common times I procrastinate each day and I replaced those times with an activity that involves both procrastinating and doing something productive. That can\u2019t be done, right? Yes it can, why not read an article on how to do something in a programming language of your choice instead of reading an article on \u201c21 things you\u2019ll never believe happened to Kim Kardashian\u201d.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBasically, what I do when I feel the need to procrastinate is, I go to my growth areas list on Evernote and choose something that I would enjoy doing at that time, then I find an activity related to that, which I find useful, easy and enjoyable and I do it. For example, last night I wanted to procrastilearn and I chose the first thing off the list, which is learning Software Development, more specifically learning React. I then went on to Google and searched for interesting React components and I just fiddled with them, it was enjoyable and I learned stuff from it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI also didn\u2019t put very strict rules in place as that would have made me feel trapped and forced and I would have quit after a couple of days. Instead, I slowly ease in to my new schedule and it\u2019s working great so far. Why not waste 2 weeks doing it gradually and actually having it work instead of doing it cold turkey and quitting after 2 days? See my point? I\u2019m slowly putting more stricter rules into place and slowly forming habits, and by not doing it all at once has helped me tremendously.\n\nWhat do you guys think about my system? Would something like this work in the long-term? I would appreciate your honest opinion. Thanks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nP.S. I know how much everyone hates self-promotion, but I've originally written this on my personal blog [here](http://csergiu.net/2017-03-17/after-years-of-struggling-with-procrastination-i-found-a-way-to-be-productive/) where it's more nicely structured and overall an easier read.\n\n",

        "post": "For almost my whole life, I was a chronic procrastinator ( I am not anymore). Since I hadn't found a solution in all that time, I decided to research and solve the problem for myself, as well as for other people in similar situations. By this time, I had a lot of experience with self-observation, psychotherapy, and meditation, as well as a basic knowledge of psychology and neuroscience.\n\nProcrastination is the act of putting off things and tasks \"for later,\" even though the procrastinator is well aware that doing so will almost certainly result in negative consequences. It appears to be simple: instead of starting something important, such as a job, studying, or organizing the chaos in the apartment, the person suddenly starts doing something else, like surfing on Instagram, checking the euro exchange rate for the past year, or even finding a truly serious activity, like watching Robert Sapolsky's lecture course on the biology of behavior on YouTube.\n\n# Let\u2019s dig into it\n\nNow, what does procrastination mean from a psychological standpoint? There are several aspects to consider. The first is that procrastination is an ineffective strategy of emotional regulation. A person tries to avoid the aversive emotions that an upcoming task can bring up, such as fear and boredom. Instead, he opts for an activity that will provide him with satisfaction in a short amount of time.\n\nThe inability to deal with arising impulses is the second aspect that emerges. Despite the importance of the task at hand and the consequences of that choice, an impulsive choice is made in favor of an activity that quickly brings positive emotions.\n\nProcrastination is a downward spiral in which the more one procrastinates, the more likely one is to apply this strategy to various plans, including work, family, personal space, and health. What\u2019s the reason for this? Because the mind perceives procrastination as a good way to get rid of negative emotions, dopamine is produced, and classic reinforcement learning occurs.\n\nThe third aspect is a low tolerance for the anticipation of a delayed reward, and thus a dopamine dose. Challenging work may yield results and benefits months later, whereas scrolling through a Facebook feed provides immediate pleasure, albeit in small amounts and with sludge, but the dopamine is there.\n\nThis isn't an exhaustive list. Procrastination has many components, and the reasons for it are different: perfectionism, fear of failure and its catastrophization, and misalignment of work goals and internal values. The tendency to procrastinate is determined by a multitude of psychological and neurophysiological factors, this is why some people procrastinate from time to time, which is considered normal, while others are essentially incapable of controlling their lives.\n\n# Misconceptions\n\nSome people who aren't familiar with the real causes and manifestations of procrastination have attractive but inaccurate ideas about it.\n\nProcrastination=laziness is the champion and most popular of these perceptions. And it all seems to add up: if someone doesn't do what he/she should, it's because they're lazy, and there's no need to bring up concepts or use nice long words to describe it. Despite their superficial resemblance, these phenomena are not the same. In other words, a lazy person does not necessarily have any goals; he/she simply does not want to exert himself for various reasons (e.g. fatigue), to put effort into anything, and is pretty comfortable with the situation.\n\nThe procrastinator, on the other hand, has goals, often lofty ones, but he/she delays their realization and the start of the action, causing distress and guilt, and substituting one activity for another. Active procrastination is a phenomenon in which the substituting activity is a productive process that is unrelated to the achievement of the procrastinator's important goals. Instead of sitting down and writing a strategy for a new project (the actual goal), he/she tackles cleaning or, for example, a Portuguese textbook.\n\nInsufficient motivation. Multiple studies on the relationship between procrastination and a variety of psychic phenomena have found very little correlation between procrastination and motivation. To put it another way, a procrastinator can be a highly motivated individual who still delays. A highly motivated person, on the other hand, is more likely to seek out opportunities to achieve their goals.\n\n# Consequences of procrastination\n\nOf course, there are a wide range of them, spanning from psychological to social, and some may occur simultaneously.\n\n1. Low productivity. Everything is self-evident here: postponing work or study assignments until the last minute or for an indefinite period of time will not lead to high results in the long run. Career risks, reduced income, and poor grades are all part of it.\n2. Loss of confidence in one's self-efficacy. This is a suitcase with two bottoms: the more a person puts off, the fewer results he/she will get. The fewer the results, the less confident he/she can be that the activity will yield them. So, what's the point of starting at all?\n3. Apathy, anxiety, and depression may emerge against this background.\n4. A lack of motivation. \"Why even start if I can't see how I can do things to the highest standard?\"\n5. Expectations for the future dwindle.\n6. In terms of the general quality of life, there is so called \"negative growth\u201d.\n7. Can cause a cognitive function to deteriorate in some cases.\n\n# Okay, but what should I do with it?\n\nThe conclusion is that developing effective emotional regulation skills should be the first step in overcoming procrastination.\n\nPsychotherapy is, naturally, the first option that comes up. Although procrastination is not currently listed in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, we can't go to the dentist with it.\n\nAnother option is to deal with the situation on your own. It may be a viable alternative for those who, for various reasons, lack access to a competent psychologist. You'll need awareness, certain skills, knowledge, and a high level of motivation to succeed. It's a challenging road to take, but it's not insurmountable.\n\nHere are two excellent daily techniques for reducing the emotional pressure of procrastination and increasing awareness you can start with.\n\n1. Forgive yourself for the past procrastination.\n\nWhen we are forgiven \u2014 or when we manage to forgive ourselves, as in the case of procrastination \u2014 we\u2019re more willing to get up and try again. Within this self-compassion, hope springs eternal in our process of becoming the selves we strive for.\n\nThink back to the previous day, and if you see that you have been putting off important things, just say to yourself: I forgive myself for this procrastination today, unconditionally. Stay in that state for a few moments, as long as you feel comfortable, feeling the tension go away. Important: you forgive yourself only for past procrastination, not for future procrastination.\n\nBlaming yourself for procrastination will not help you anyhow but only increase your distress level. This will prevent you from getting to work since distress freezes your mind\u2019s ability to choose effective adaptive strategies. So let\u2019s say goodbye to this source of stress.\n\n2. Stop promising yourself that you will do/start doing tomorrow what you keep delaying.\n\nOnce you notice this thought in the offing of your mind, catch and throw it out of your head, just don\u2019t let it into your mind. Be attentive, and you will easily be able to determine the moment when this thought appears and stop it.\n\nThere are several reasons why you should stop doing it. The first reason is that you do it all the time, but nothing changes, so stop deluding yourself. The second is that when you decide to leave something until tomorrow, it's like you've \u201csolved the problem\u201d, so your brain gets some dopamine (a neurotransmitter involved in the reward and learning systems in our brains), and you feel relieved. You fall into a habitual trap where you don't need real results to get dopamine. But the truth is, getting results and achieving goals is what you need, not just a little dose of dopamine.",

Tough week, difficult task, many road blocks (good to test the exercise).\n\nThe week 2 exercise was useless. A drink/pushup break did nothing. It was often hard to follow. Often it spiraled into facebook/tv. I realised this early, but decided to see all exercises through to the end of the week. \n\nFailures are important. Reflect, learn, improve. \n\nAlso, the week 1 exercise was good. It's definitely feeling more natural to start working in various circumstances.\n\n**Week 3: Road Blocks 2.0**\n\nI usually take a \"skim read core material and dive right in\" approach. It usually saves time. Googling fills in the knowledge gaps very quickly.\n\nLast week it backfired. After being stuck for 5+ hours, I went back and spent 2-3 hours noting the core material (on Microsoft Word). This solved the issue.\n\nConclusions from week 2:\n\n1. Many road blocks stem from misunderstanding core material.\n\n2. Road blocks starve you of progress. This means 'usually tedious' processes (e.g. noting) feel rewarding instead.\n\nExercise for week 3:\n\n1. Define an easy but tedious task and a time estimate for it. e.g. noting core material, ~2 hours. \n\n2. When you are stuck for more than half the time estimate, change over to that task.\n\n ",

        "post": "For the past decade, I've been battling procrastination.  Only in the last 3 months have I learned to manage my productivity.  \nEveryone knows the solution: Pick a goal, break it down into tasks, make them small enough not to be intimidating, and then just do it. It's a simple recipe, yet millions subscribe to productivity subreddits.  \nI knew there had to be some way to beat procrastination. So I kept trying new methods. And also because my palms sweat once I stumble upon a promise of 10x productivity on Twitter.\n\n# Productivity Techniques\n\n**Daily Manifest**\n\nI tried Daily Manifest\u00a0\u2014 a To-Do list template from the author of Visualize Value blog. Set goals, list tasks, then choose three task for a day. Each template on a separate page.  \nInspired by Twitter reviews, I printed and filled the template.  And repeatedly found myself sidetracked by abandoned Wikipedia articles rabbithole.\n\nTo-Do lists as a technique have a problem: once tasks are written down, I can't even start with the first one. Undone tasks moved to later, then moved to the next page. If you don't discard the filled template paper, a stack of sheets reminds you of your fail. A procrastinator starts to feel guilty.\n\n**Pomodoro**\n\nI also tried a Pomodoro technique. Work the task for 20 minutes, take a 5 minute break and repeat.  \nI downloaded an app, listed tasks, and immediately got distracted for the rest of Pomodoro. Frustrated, I skipped the 5 minute break. Thinking that I don't need rest after procrastination. Starting the next Pomodoro and got distracted once again.  \nAttention just slips away with these timers. A distraction during a Pomodoro leads to guilt. Mess up 2-3 Pomodoros, and that guilt really weighs on you.  \nIt's fortunate that there is a word 'procrastination' replacing 'lazy.' It carries less guilt. Procrastination started to became an obstacle, but then I joined a new team. \n\n# New Job\n\nI joined a team that builds Busy StatusBar \u2014 a desktop LED display with a large button that you press, and the display would shows 'Busy'.  \nNaturally, my tendency to let my attention slip from important tasks didn't vanish. As soon as I started setting task for myself at the new place, I start checking social networks, reading A NEWSLETTER THAT CAN'T WAIT, and getting sidetracked by conversations with colleagues.  \nIn addition to 'Busy' status, the display could also show a timer. Initially, this was done with the idea that colleagues would see how long you'd be busy. It turned out to be suitable for the Pomodoro technique as well. So, the device can help others distract me less, and also help me to keep focusing on my tasks.  \nHaving a productivity device to build, I decided: it is time to tackle procrastination. I would experiment with different methods, choose effective techniques, and share my journey. After all, I have my whole lifetime ahead, and procrastination is not going anywhere itself. I can do as many mistakes as needed on the path to a sustainable working model.  \nThe first week, I managed to complete 4-8 logged Pomodoros a day. And a some unlogged ones, I'll explain later. \n\nI guess an effective attention management routine should be build on the following principles:\n\n1. **Log your work.** What gets measured gets managed. Afraid of skipping your worklog for a day or two? Ok, get back to logging with no guilt. Done for 20% is better then done to 0. If you can only take one thing from this post, pick this one. \n2. **Reduce Guilt**. Let's admit that we will still get distracted from time to time. I continue to get distracted every day. Sometimes I find myself scrolling unfamiliar meme page. But now I can track that I spent only 2 minutes of 20 minute Pomodoro on this. I don't blame myself and easily get back to work. \n3. **Rest to gain resource**. It was not obvious for me at first. I would skip 5 minute break, once got distracted during a Pomodoro. But I was lack of energy for the next 20 minutes after. Do not know how to rest? Leave your phone, yawn and stretch. You would feel it in your body. Nobody would be productive with no resource to spend.\n4. **Minimise Friction**. If I would spend 20 minutes sorting tasks using Eisenhower's Technique \u2014\u00a0 I would never start. Kill every notification and find a shortcut to turn on Focus Mode.   \nLess friction \u2192\u00a0More reps \u2192\u00a0More neural pathways \u2192\u00a0Easier to get to work.\n5. **Positive Feedback Loop**. When I see a stack of failed To-Do lists, enthusiasm disappears. Set your productivity routine to be joyful, especially the first steps. So that you feel good about yourself even if you only did 3 out of 10 tasks. After all, you could have done none.\n\nThere was one more challenge. I didn't believe that overcoming procrastination was ever possible. Please share your stories on how you managed to improve your productivity. ",

        "post": "I am sometimes a heavy procrastinator. I am self employed so it isn't totally necessary for me to have a set schedule for when I do work. It isn't even necessary for me to get the same amount of hours every week.\n\nThis leads me to fill my time with BS that doesn't help me. I had a dialogue with my inner procrastination monkey, and I realized that it would be more fulfilled if I was in a place where I had more passive income. So I will begin working harder to fulfill my procrastination monkey more, but in return it has to allow me to work more than I am now.\n\nOur plan is to take turns. I have many procrastination interests: reddit, tv, chatrooms, social medias, random game/chat/puzzle apps on my phone, reading fiction (which isn't always procrastination...) and the like. I also have 3-4 work modes that could eventually become specialized jobs or individual careers.\n\nThe rules for taking turns go like this:\n\nWhoever's turn it is, that guy (procrastination monkey or productivity me) chooses one of the modes/interests. They are then allowed to spend as much time as they like, *but only on that interest.* If they get bored of that interest, then they have to allow the other half a turn to do the same thing. This continues in such a way as I get a LOT more work done because typically I don't get bored very quickly when I'm in work mode.\n\nFor example, let's say it's the procrastination monkey's turn. It can choose ONE way to procrastinate. So Twitter, Reddit, an app, OR tv. As time goes on, it will get more and more bored with the activity until it wants to switch to another one (for example, from reddit to tv). At this point, it is not allowed to switch tasks, but it must either give up its turn or continue with that procrastination mode.\n\nAfter it gives up, now it is the worker's turn. It can also choose ONE mode of work. When it gets bored or exhausted, it can either continue with that mode or give up and allow the procrastination monkey to have a turn.\n\nNormally this works wonders for me. Because my procrastination tends to be split among multiple apps and types, it becomes very difficult to chain hours together where I'm not getting anything done. And every time I want to switch to a different mode of procrastination, I have a very salient opportunity to switch into work mode.",

Some days I am focussed, usually if I\u2019ve slept well, done a good morning workout, and the work I\u2019m doing is interesting. But on bad days, when I\u2019m less focussed and motivated, I wonder over to sites like YouTube and Twitter far too often and end up spending way too much time down the rabbit hole.\r\n\r\nI recently began a morning meditation routine, usually meditating for around 15 mins each morning. Meditation is very simple \u2013 that\u2019s the point. I just sit in my office chair, breath and watch my mind. Not judging or condemning any thoughts, just watching and breathing.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning at 8:30, I meditated for 15 mins. I then worked solidly for around 1 hour. I then got stuck on a problem and naturally, by habit, I was wondering over to Twitter. BUT, and this is very important, I caught myself doing it. I was actually aware of the fact that I\u2019d stumbled on a challenging problem in my work, and so my mind was like \u201chmm challenging, lets make life easier and mindlessly & aimlessly scroll through Twitter\u201d. \r\n\r\nBut I caught myself doing it, and so the more logical me could say \u201cHaha, caught you!

        "post": "Procrastination frustrates me. I get work done but it's always at the end of the day. When I want to do something fun, I always feel guilt. Sucks when the sun is down most of the day.\n\nAfter serious reflection & learning, I finally freaking figured it out. \n\n**Be kind to yourself.**\n\nSounds simple but incredibly hard to apply. We automatically have negative thought patterns and it gets worse with procrastination. Starting anything is tough -- even while writing this Reddit post, I observed negative thoughts coming out. \n\nNow, here's how you can really apply it. A small, simple trick -\n\n**What's a small positive thought that I can easily generate right now?** It should be something specific about the task at hand. \n\nLet's say you have to finish a big essay. You really don't want to do it, it's hard, will take a long time, and it's due in 5 days. But you know you've gotta get a little bit done so you don't get screwed. So I propose \"**a pause**\". \n\nYour first task is to think about the task at hand in some positive manner. Even if it really sucks (lol), think about the big picture. **5 minutes, a piece of paper, and a pen.** Write or draw something positive that somehow connects to your task. If it gets you in a rhythm, you could: \n\nDraw, write, plan the project out, pseudocode, a small rough draft of the essay. You could even walk and think. Do whatever! You deserve it, you're about to do something incredible -- produce quality work & learn.\n\nOn the Tim Ferriss show, Jerry Seinfeld explained, \"*One of the most difficult things there is, way harder than weight training, way harder, what you\u2019re summoning, trying to summon within your brain and your spirit, to create something onto a blank page.*\u201d\n\nDoing work is hard for everyone. The trick is to seriously encourage yourself -- 1 positive thought to 1 positive action. Then, who knows, you might finish everything :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you enjoyed reading this! Going to post more of my reflections on Reddit.",

We've hit the project's boring/tedious/difficult bits.\n7. We're surrounded by tantalizing distractions\n8. We struggle to get started because we'll just be interrupted in a few minutes, breaking our flow.\n9. We feel overwhelmed by the enormity of the project.\n10. We struggle with perfectionism\n11. We get sucked into distraction spirals. A 5-minute Reddit break turns into two hours.\n12. We do many urgent but unimportant tasks, so there's no time/energy for the important stuff.\n13. We seek distractions to quiet the monkey brain. (If we could snap our fingers and silence the mental chatter, we'd be more productive.)\n14. We dream of creating something amazing and perfect. Once we start the work, the ability to create something perfect disappears. As long as we don't start, perfection feels possible.\n15. We talk about projects and daydream a lot. These feel good and feel like progress. But these good feelings diminish our motivation to actually get started.\n16. We dream of doing so many things. It's hard to commit to one project because it means saying No to a dozen others. Not starting on a project means we're keeping our options open.\n17. We seek out distractions to soothe negative emotions.\n18. We fear judgment and criticism.\n19. We fear making mistakes.\n20. We fear failing\n21. We have imposter syndrome.\n22. We have too many concurrent projects/responsibilities. This causes us to constantly switch contexts and/or feel overwhelmed. This kills any chance of getting into a flow state.\n23. We feel like other people don't have to work as hard, and it's not fair that things take so much effort for us.\n24. We don't have anyone to cheer us on, celebrate tiny wins and small victories, etc\n25. We don't have anyone holding us accountable.\n26. We're surrounded by people who procrastinate, so it feels normal to put things off. Who wants to be the only person not procrastinating?\n27.

        "post": "**When I procrastinate, I often find the same reason: some part of my brain feels discomfort or fear.**\n\nI'm not scared of the task itself; when I dig deeper, I often find the fear is about what happens if I complete the task. Here's a current example from my own life.\n\nA podcaster asked me to be a guest in January 2023. She had one request: create a gift for her audience. That's a normal request, so I began sketching ideas for the gift. After little progress for a few days, I checked in with my brain, in a friendly way, to see what was going on.\n\nMe: \"Hey, we've been procrastinating on the gift for a few days. You alright? Something on your mind?\"  \nBrain: \"I'm scared.\"\n\nMe: \"Scared of what?\"  \nBrain: \"What if the gift isn't good enough? What if they hate it?\"  \n\n\n**I sensed that my brain wasn't telling me the entire truth. I sensed there was something else.**  \nSitting silently for a bit, I felt its fear wasn't about the audience judging the gift as a bad gift.\n\nI sensed that my brain was scared of the audience judging us. In other words, the ego didn't like the possibility of being judged badly. This kind of surprised me, but I went with the flow.  \n\n\n**Once I understood this was really about my ego feeling scared of being judged, I shifted gears.**\n\nMe: \"Hey, how well could her audience really know us after one interview next month?\"  \nBrain: \"Well, they'd barely know us.\"\n\nMe: \"Let's say they hate our gift. Does it mean they hate us?\"  \nBrain: \"I guess not.\"\n\nMe: \"Have you ever gotten a crappy gift?\"  \nBrain: \"Ha ha, sure.\"\n\nMe: \"Did you hate the person giving us gift?\"  \nBrain: \"Of course not.\"\n\nMe: \"What if we just focus on creating a cool gift? We can't control the reaction, can we?\"  \nBrain: \"I guess not. Yeah, I can focus on creating a cool gift.\"\n\nOnce we ended the chat, \"we\" began creating the gift in more detail. Team effort instead of me pushing to make it happen.\n\n**After the chat, I went from 10% done to about 50% done with the gift within 30 minutes.**   \nIt felt good to make such rapid progress after having felt stuck for days.\n\n**Bottom line: Sometimes procrastination is a smokescreen. The real issue is discomfort or fear.**\n\nI wasn't being lazy. My ego was just scared of releasing a product in which we might be judged. My ego's solution made sense; don't finish the product. But its solution wasn't great in other ways, obviously.\n\nI'm posting this on December 23rd, so may you all have a Merry Christmas or wonderful holiday in whatever way you celebrate.",

        "post": "I often struggle with procrastination. It frustrates me a lot, so I came up with some tricks to help myself procrastinate less and get more done. They don\u2019t always work perfectly, but I do think they help. I figured that it would be a good idea to share the tricks here as they might help someone else too. \n\n**Overwhelm**\n\nSometimes you procrastinate simply because you are not quite sure what to do. In those moments it is important to break down your goals into smaller and more manageable sub-goals. You can then turn these sub goals into a plan. Having a plan can reduce overwhelm dramatically. \n\n**Focus on starting**\n\nInstead of focussing on the task you need to do, which can often be big, boring and intimidating, just focus on the first step. For example, if you need to write a paper, don\u2019t focus on writing the paper, but on sitting down at your computer and firing up word.\n\n**No perfect moment**\n\nDon\u2019t wait for the perfect moment. You will probably never feel like doing the thing you're supposed to do, and putting it off until some hypothetical perfect moment is just a trick procrastination pulls on you.  \n\n**Promise yourself a reward**\n\nPromise yourself a reward for completing the task or working for a certain amount of time. For example, if you want to watch a youtube video, promise yourself that you can watch it after you have done some work. Having guilt-free and well deserved leisure time to look forward to can be a great motivator. \n\n**Work in longer blocks**\n\nThis one might be a bit controversial. Taking breaks is very important, but I have found that it is easier to work a few long blocks than to work a lot of smaller blocks. This is simply because procrastination is the hardest to overcome when you are not working, so every time you take a break, it is a big opportunity to procrastinate.",

        "post": "# Do you ever find yourself watching YouTube videos that have little to do with your daily life while delaying all priorities to \"do it later\" time zone?\n\nI'm talking about cat videos, world-class cooking recipes, ASMR, and even gameplay. While being informative and high quality, when was the last time you\u2019ve utilized those skills and know-how?\n\nYou might say to yourself, \u2018I\u2019ll use them one day\u2019. But when? In all honesty, most videos we watch aren\u2019t important, useful, and even entertaining. They\u2019re used for procrastination.\n\nIn 2017, YouTube announced that we watch more than 1 billion hours per day. Considering the most-watched contents are not about physics or math, it\u2019s easy to presume how much time is wasted.\n\nSo, how do we stop procrastination on YouTube? Is there a way to prevent its\u2019 endless rabbit hole that always seems to end up on K-pop and foreign shows?\n\nTo compartmentalize this problem, we must first look at science and figure out why we procrastinate.\n\n**Bad genes**\n\nNo, you\u2019re not lazy or hopeless.\n\nThe first thing we must accept is the harsh reality of biology. Some readers might not like this fact, but some of us are born with a greater tendency of procrastination than others. By scanning your amygdala with MRI, research suggests that individuals differ in their ability to initiate self- and emotional-control mechanisms. Simply speaking, *Sarah* might have a better chance of self-control than *John* because of her genes.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not responsible for your actions! It just means you might have a harder time controlling your goal-oriented actions than others. The key here is *self-acceptance*, not making excuses.\n\nFurthermore, behavioral genetic studies reinforce this theory. To make us feel all better about our decision for eating a cookie at 11 PM, the studies suggest that procrastination and impulsivity are linked with your genes.\n\nWhat\u2019s our next move? Should we just give up?\n\nOf course not!\n\nNow we know that decks are stacked against us, we should be able to find loopholes and tricks in the system. I mean... just because some of us got an unlucky draw, we shouldn\u2019t just quit journaling and crawl into a hole.\n\n**Tools**\n\nBefore we get into the actual brain hacks, get to know these tools to analyze your time on YouTube and put a stop on it.\n\n1. IPhone's screen time restriction for YouTube (FREE)\n2. Block YouTube for mac and window desktops (FREE)\n3. Android alternative\n\n# Methods\n\n**1. Reset the Brain**\n\nReset your brain when you feel the urge to watch the next one. This can be done by closing your eyes and counting down from *5 to 0*.\n\nHabitual reactions are partly embedded in a deep part of the brain called the basal ganglia. The five-second countdown helps shift from the embedded pattern, which has previously been rewarded in some way (videos), to help engage our prefrontal cortex, which can guide us to an alternative behaviour.\n\nHowever, this method won\u2019t always work on the first try. You\u2019re likely destined to face internal resistance to completely turn the thinking around. If it doesn\u2019t work, try again. If you have auto-play turned on, please turn it off to make things more difficult.\n\nCountdown from 5 and imagine resetting your brain. The better you become at this, it\u2019ll influence other parts of your life.\n\n**2. 5 minute rule**\n\nJames Clear, the author of the best-seller book, Atomic Habit, said you shouldn\u2019t focus too much on setting goals, but the smallest wins to naturally push you onward. If you\u2019re watching a cat video on YouTube, but need to study or get some work done-\n\n* Set out to do just 5 minutes.\n* Once you get started, that 5 minutes could extend to 30 minutes or an hour.\n* If you don\u2019t feel like doing more, just stop and do it at another time.\n* You\u2019ve still done more than 0.\n\nOne of my favourite brain hacks.\n\n**3. Replace the boredom and anxiety**\n\nReplace. Replace. Replace.\n\nWe can\u2019t stress this enough. Most YouTube procrastination happens not because you\u2019re truly interested in the content, but you want to fill the boredom and don\u2019t want to cope with the stress that comes with productive activities.\n\nSome say just push it through...but we disagree.\n\nInstead of always working, fill that time with something that doesn\u2019t involve your phone or a computer. Play basketball, meet your friends for a hike, or any other activities that can stimulate the brain. Dopamine and happiness chemicals come from a variety of things.\n\nYou may also watch a video while doing something productive, like *cleaning your room*.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to stop watching YouTube nor will it be easy to break away from it. You should aim to do this slowly with the smallest step possible. Let\u2019s recap.\n\n* Prepare tools to track and stop your YouTube binge.\n* Use the 5-minute rule to reset the brain and break everything down to small wins.\n* Replace boredom and anxiety with an activity.\n\nOn average, people spend a couple hours a day watching videos online. If you can half that, you\u2019ll have at least **5-10 extra hours** a week compared to your peers.\n\nP.S: If you need help with breaking bad habits, follow our FREE neuroscience app, [Synapse](https://www.braintingle.io/).

Even activities I usually enjoy, like guitar practice, seem impossible to start.\n\nWith major exams approaching, my procrastination is becoming an actual threat to my goals.

        "post": "1) I'm feeling unhappy with my reality and unmotivated, so I go on pinterest or tiktok to escape it. Hopefully I come across some valuable information or a pretty post that would inspire me and give me a better vision of my goals. I end up just procrastinating. Oh how I wish I could romanticize my own life instead of a stranger's.\n\n2) I wake up and I gotta check my phone first thing in the morning in case I've missed an important call or message for someone. Accidentally I get sucked into the rabbithole of social media.\n\n3) I'm trying to focus on something, but I'm afraid to leave my phone in another room in case I don't hear it and my relatives start worrying or in case I miss some plans in the group chat with my friends and see it too late. So I keep my phone nearby. Even though it's not ringing or buzzing, I have an urge to check just in case. Boom, I get sucked into the vortex again. \n\n4) Deleting the apps that are bad for me doesn't really work because I need them in some way. I use those same apps for messaging and researching topics that are relevant to my life. I've learned a lot of things thanks to reddit, tiktok and youtube. But meanwhile my finger slips in the wrong direction and without realizing I'm watching a tutorial on how to look after a lizard or those stupid fake prank videos. Hours pass. \n\n5) I post something whether on instagram or on reddit and I then gotta check how my post's doing. So I keep wasting time. OCD makes matters even worse because sometimes I worry I might've posted something I shouldn't have, so I gotta check before many people see - like somehow dropping my phone on my face might've opened my camera, then facebook and posted the picture of my front camera smashing my face.",

Luckily I have passed and is done with all my exams right now, so I can focus on doing things which is highly productive and hopefully does not involve screen.\n\nJust to give you a brief sneak peek of my life, I work a 9-5 job in Auditing, so I am in front of a screen everyday, and with busy season starting in January, I might be working over 12 hours a day. Apart from that, my time goes in cooking and normal human habits, and then just scrolling through tiktok/insta and catching up with family.\n\nI would love to know your tips and tricks or activities you do to reduce your screen time! Just an important note, my 'free' time during the weekdays will be mostly during the evening/night, so habits suiting that timing would be better ",

Procrastination isn\u2019t likened to laziness, because it\u2019s an active process. The person deliberately chooses to do something else instead of the task being given to them. Mindtools.com says that it, \u201cis the habit of delaying an important task, usually by focusing on less urgent, more enjoyable, and easier activities instead. The difference between procrastination is the thin line of activeness, because laziness is really the unwillingness to act, while procrastination is still doing something just not what you were supposed to do. Procrastination can be remedied, by you, and only you! The things you have to do and the supposed \u201ccure\u201d to procrastination, can only really work if you condition yourself for it. How do I know? Because I\u2019ve been there too. I used to be like that, putting off one small task and the other, and then I eventually put my own dreams to the side, and I wasn\u2019t really in a place in my life where I was strong enough to commit to what I set out for the day, week, month or even the year. So, I worked on myself,  day-by-day goals, and I just\u2026 started rewiring my bad habits. Just a little inspiration. I wasn't born perfect.\n\nPS. Hussle League",

        "post": "Tl;Dr at the end \n\nThink about what you're doing when you are procrastinating.\n\nI suspect it's either social media and Netflix or eating or all of these, but yeah everybody knows that, what's special about this? it's the fact that you are finding ways to numb your self and stop thinking above all else. Why? Because if you think, you're likely to stress out.\n\nSo your behaviour is to stop yourself from being overwhelmed and stressed\n\nSo okay procrastinating has to do with stress and anxiety even if it's minor it can trigger procrastination. Is that all? No, lack of clarity and a sense of being overwhelmed also contributes to this. \n\nIf you're starting something big then you're likely to procrastinate since its something that changes how you view yourself. For instance, I\u2019ve been procrastinating on learning photography and posting it online. That\u2019s because I don\u2019t view myself as a photographer (in fact, I view myself as a shit photographer) and thus I\u2019ve been procrastinating on taking photos for longer than I care to admit.\n\nThe nebulous feeling of just not getting started is emotional resistance. Even if it is something exciting that you've been thinking about like the photo series I mentioned earlier, then the more you keep thinking how awesome something will be the more likely you are to procrastinate. I keep thinking how amazing it is going to be and since I can never meet my own unreal expectations (specially as a noob) so I keep on procrastinating. \n\n**What to do about it**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Do something rule**: Everybody can invent a productivity rule right? Here\u2019s mine: Do something, literally anything, seriously, do something. If you\u2019re able to do this constantly, you\u2019ll begin to notice when you procrastinate and why you\u2019re doing it. Even if you don\u2019t do anything about it immediately, noticing goes a long way in minimising procrastination .\n   1. Example: Keep your books on your table and call that a win (no, actually do that) open your note taking app and write down the heading and if you do that you\u2019re allowed to get up. \n2. **Actually procrastinate**: i'm not going to say that you stop for ever but if you're able to schedule some time where you can do whatever without expectations that can be helpful. Each day some time to indulge in mindless scrolling, Netflix or whatever you\u2019re into. Since I\u2019ve done this, I don\u2019t procrastinate as much when I\u2019m supposed to be working/studying.\n3. This is where **Stoicism** helped me: The stoics did something called the *evening meditation.* Essentially, you sit and think to yourself what went well in the day, what did you do well and what didn't you do well and how can you improve it. Personally, i like to write this out since having it in front of me is helpful in clarifying what i need to do the next day.\n\nThe conclusion that i've come to is that to minimise the amount of procrastination you need to design your life in such a way that you get constant feedback from your systems to keep focused.\n\nThat\u2019s been my experience with procrastination. Hope that helps.\n\nP.s: Video version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4h_3rMpRrA&t=273s)\n\nTl;Dr: Pay attention to underlying reasons of your procrastination usually: stress, overwhelm, expectations and something that threatens your identity. Do get out of it: do something (anything), have unstructured time in your day without expectations and try a daily review/evening meditation.",

Deep down, some part of us thinks it\u2019s horribly unfair that we have to do pointless homework, write boring essays, and study for stupid tests. (I call this part of me the Grumbler.)\n\nThe Grumbler never wants to study, never wants to work. Instead, he demands rest and relaxation at all times. (My Grumbler\u2019s ideal day includes sleeping late, gobbling Albanese gummy bears (in bed, of course), and binging Netflix crime thrillers (also in bed). If it were up to him, I\u2019d never leave my bed!)\n\nNo matter how much rest we give ourselves, the Grumbler resists anything resembling work. He whines, \u201cYou\u2019re so mean! Why do you make me do crap? Netflix won\u2019t watch itself! No one else has to work hard; why should I???\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s his favorite phrase: It\u2019s not fair!\n\nNow, when we procrastinate our studies for days (weeks?), we\u2019ve surrendered to the Grumbler. When we put off studying, we\u2019ve given in to the Grumbler\u2019s demands. He gets what he wants, but we pay the price.\n\nBut there\u2019s a solution. Ignore the Grumbler and study for just 5 minutes. We have enough willpower to do a 5-minute sprint.\n\nIf we study for 5 minutes, we overcome the Resistance and build momentum. If we do a 5-minute sprint, we can do a second one. And a third.\n\nIf we can build momentum today, we can do it tomorrow. We can do it every day.\n\nWe overcome procrastination by building momentum. And it all starts by ignoring the Grumbler for 5 minutes.\n\nYou can study for 5 minutes, right?",

        "post": "If you're in a cycle of procrastination, the effort to start whatever you're supposed to be doing might feel like a mountain to climb (making it even harder to start it). Instead, quickly change your context. Stand up, walk around your house/office, go get a glass of water, whatever. This will give you a small ego boost, and possibly help you beat the cycle!\n   \n &nbsp;    \n     \nI discovered that I procrastinate because I want to put off the potential feeling of failure and self-pity DURING the task that comes with not having enough time to finish a task in the way that I'd like it to be done (perfectionist). In college, I was able to pull all-nighters to make \"perfection\" happen, but now my body has basically said \"no, we're not doing this anymore\", so my procrastination has been at an all time high. I'll scroll Reddit for hours or do Netflix binges instead of doing what I'm supposed to be doing, and the task becomes more and more tremendous in my mind. So my trick is: When I notice I'm procrastinating, I get up and do something different. Anything at all. Brownie points if it's something \"productive\" like putting the dishes away or getting a glass of water for myself. Sometimes I pace around my room. That's enough effort and change of context to allow me to step back and ask myself if it's procrastination is worth the pain. ",

        "title": "Case Study: How Lila Beat Procrastination Using 5-Minute Sprints",
        "post": "Hey, friends!\n\nHas this ever happened to you? You have this big audacious goal, but you endlessly procrastinate? Maybe you dream of learning Spanish or running an online business, but you\u2019re never motivated to work on it.\n\nThis scenario has happened to me countless times. It\u2019s also happened to Lila (a friend in my writer\u2019s group). She\u2019s drafting her first novel, *India House*, but struggled with procrastination. We chatted about what\u2019s driving her procrastination, and she identified three key issues:\n\n**One:** Publishing a novel is a huge undertaking. It requires hundreds of hours, and this feels overwhelming.\n\n**Two:** Writing requires concentration, but Lila is often interrupted by her toddler. She also fears getting interrupted. Why bother starting when you\u2019ll be interrupted in five minutes?\n\n**Three:** Lila has many responsibilities that are more urgent than writing. Before her daughter was born, laundry wasn\u2019t a big deal. But now, ensuring her kid has clean clothes is the most important thing on the planet. Laundry (and 1,000 other things) supplanted writing time.\n\nAt the same time, Lila has a nagging feeling that whispers, \u201cYou should be writing\u2026\u201d This nagging feeling, this low-grade anxiety, pops up at the most inopportune times. Relaxing with a Netflix show? \u201cYou should be writing\u2026\u201d Dinner with friends? \u201cYou should be writing\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the worst of both worlds: Lila can\u2019t find the time to write and can\u2019t silence the feeling that she should be writing.\n\n## Enter 5-minute sprints\n\nLila experimented with variations of the Pomodoro Technique (25-minute sprints) and found something that works: 5-minute writing sprints.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Lila eliminates distractions and writes for five minutes. Then, she takes a 1-minute break. Each cycle is 6 minutes.\n\nAfter 5 cycles, Lila has focused for 25 minutes (Hurray!), and she takes a 10-minute break.\n\n## Benefits\n\nDuring cycles, Lila builds a feeling of momentum. Each cycle is easier to start than the one before. Each cycle builds on the previous. It\u2019s like that saying from Aristotle, \u201cWell begun is half done.\u201d\n\nWith short sprints, Lila trains her brain to focus. She\u2019s building that mental muscle with interval training. And she\u2019s overcoming the Resistance to getting started.\n\n(How often do we abandon goals\u2014and give up on dreams\u2014because we don\u2019t overcome our own internal Resistance?)\n\nLila\u2019s momentum carries over from day to day. Yesterday\u2019s sprints (and the pile of words written) motivate her to start today\u2019s first sprint. And if she completes 1 sprint, she\u2019ll do 5 or even 10.\n\nAfter a writing session, Lila\u2019s subconscious crew works hard on what to write about next. What should the next scene be about? What does the protagonist want? What obstacles will he face? The next day, Lila\u2019s subconscious crew provides insights on what to write. They make it easy to start her first sprint.\n\nBest of all, Lila can quiet that nagging feeling that she should be writing. When she\u2019s enjoying Netflix, and the feeling pops up, Lila looks at what she wrote that day and feels good. She feels good about her progress and she feels good about herself.\n\n## Raising the bar\n\nRecently, Lila graduated to 10-minute sprints. Longer sprints lead to more words and more motivation.\n\nBut Lila is mindful of motivation levels. When she\u2019s feeling unmotivated, she does a 3-minute sprint to build momentum. And when she\u2019s feeling highly motivated (and the toddler is asleep), she does a 20-minute sprint. This flexibility maximizes her time writing and overcomes her internal Resistance.\n\nThis flexibility is how we build momentum. **Momentum is the antidote to procrastination.**\n\nNow, am I oversimplifying things? Yes, of course. This strategy requires real work. Real effort.\n\nLila\u2019s first sprint is the hardest, and she may only write 30 words. That\u2019s not many, but 30 is better than nothing. 30 builds momentum. The next sprint yields more words, and after several sprints, she often writes 150 words per sprint. With each sprint, her progress snowballs. With each sprint, her momentum soars.\n\nAnd it all began with a 5-minute sprint.\n\n## Take action: Beat Procrastination Using 5-Minute Sprints\n\nAre you procrastinating on an assignment? Spend 5 minutes on it. Use this time to make a To Do list or a list of questions. Use this time to break your assignment into chunks, and those chunks into bite-sized smaller pieces. Then, focus on one piece for a 5-minute sprint, and feel your momentum grow.\n\nAre you putting off learning Spanish? Spend 5 minutes on it. Use this time to make a To Do list or brainstorm what to learn next? Is it vocabulary, verb conjugation, or pronunciation? Use this time to make a flash card or sing along with an Enrique Iglesias music video. Do a sprint, then a second, and feel your momentum grow.\n\n## Beware of three traps\n\nPeople often fall into several traps. (I\u2019ve fallen into all of them many, many times!)\n\n**One:** We start way too big. (Let\u2019s do 90-minute sprints!) Bigger is better, right? Bigger is more productive. But the real obstacle, the real thing we\u2019re optimizing for, is overcoming the Resistance to getting started. Getting started is the hardest part. So, start small.\n\n**Two:** We split our focus. (Let\u2019s do sprints for 37 goals.) Maybe we dream of learning Spanish and starting an online business and improving our physical health and taking an online class and starting a YouTube channel and creating a popular blog and a dozen more things. But each of these requires many hours to make measurable progress. Some (like Spanish) require hundreds of hours. There\u2019s not enough time to do everything right now. But there\u2019s time to do one thing and do it well.\n\n**Three:** We procrastinate our first sprint. (Let\u2019s do a sprint\u2026 tomorrow\u2026) Today\u2019s excuses follow us into tomorrow. If we can\u2019t find the gumption, if we can\u2019t find the intestinal fortitude to do a 5-minute sprint today, we won\u2019t do one tomorrow. Tomorrow, the Resistance will be just as strong.\n\nWe might as well start today.",

        "title": "4 quick tips for the artist that procrastinates",
        "post": "As artist we put too much pressure on ourselves, we want to create that amazing piece that will elevate us to the next level and let us become masters of our craft. Most of the time though, our own work makes us feel disappointed. We don\u2019t feel it\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d, we feel like we\u2019ve done better in the past, etc. But, the key to making amazing things, is to dedicate time to practice, even if the \u201cpractice art\u201d ends up being crappy. Today I\u2019m going to share with you 4 quick tips that will help you become a more disciplined artist\n\n1. Avoid falling into the \u201cperfection trap\u201d. Like I mentioned before, it\u2019s important you don\u2019t put unnecessary pressure on yourself. Practice makes perfect, so I want you to change your focus. Instead of setting goals like \u201cI want to create an amazing piece of art that amazes people\u201d, why don\u2019t you try setting a more realistic goal like \u201cI will create x pieces of art (make it a realistic number as well) this month\u201d. Your only goal is to sit down and get to work, not to paint the next Mona Lisa. Get into the habit of working and you\u2019ll improve faster than you could\u2019ve ever imagined.\n2. Have a deliberate practice routine. So this tip goes tied with tip number 1. It\u2019s very easy to just work when you feel creative, inspired and motivated, but relying on those feelings is a recipe for disaster, you can\u2019t control when you\u2019ll feel like that, so you are at a great disadvantage if you only work every once in a while. Resolve to have a regular practice routine where you don\u2019t just do the \u201cfun\u201d stuff, but the stuff that\u2019s actually going to make you improve down the road.\n3. Make it easy to start. Hard, confusing tasks create stress. Your brain hates feeling stressed, this is why it would rather get some instant gratification, like watching some Netflix, instead of long-term gratification. It is the goal of every \u201cprocrastinator\u201d to win that battle and choose long-term gratification. Make your work as clear as possible, as easy to start as possible and as enjoyable as possible. Why don\u2019t you try telling yourself you\u2019ll only work for 10 minutes, and once those 10 minutes pass you are free to do whatever you want. If you pay close attention, the hard part isn\u2019t doing your work, it\u2019s STARTING, once you do things get easier. Try it for yourself.\n4. Enjoy the process. You make art because you enjoy and love creating, that\u2019s it. Once again (and I\u2019ll repeat it as many times as necessary) don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself. Yes, you want to be more disciplined, but you also need to take the time and relax, this will show in your work. Don\u2019t go to either extreme and you\u2019ll be fine, enjoy creating!\n\n\\---\n\n\nThank you for reading, I hope you found this post useful and get to work as soon as you can.\n\n\nAlso, if you prefer watching a video over reading, then you might be interested in checking out my YouTube channel, you can find it by  [clicking on my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheSimranSingh) take care!\n\n\n\\-Simran",

        "post": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI tried a lot to beat my procrastination habit but I failed almost every time and can't explain the guilt after that.\n\nTried setting alarms, tried to wake up early nothing worked. Finally, after I was fed up.\n\nI Changed from forcing myself to trying to figure out how I can be consistent and beat procrastination.\n\nHere is my learning\n\n1. **Diet plays a huge role**. I felt sleepy/lethargic every time I even thought of starting anything. So first thing I tried was to reduce the amount of food intake(no other change in diet food I ate was as before).  It gave better results than expected my focus improved dramatically and was more willing to start things.\n2. **Water intake**  This was a suggestion from a friend I kept a bottle near me whenever I started working. Took a sip or two every few minutes. Not sure how but it helped Me keep concentration levels for a long time actually worked better than Coffee for me.\n3. **A clear list of things broken into tiny chunks** After a lot of hit and trial I figured out that my mind was willing to stay on tasks which are clear and very precise instead of something broad\n4. **Create a List for next day Last night before sleeping**\n5. **Use a habit tracking app**\n\nI wanted to learn **App Development and was procrastinating for months** on it. So I broke it into tiny chunks.\n\nStarted with making a list of the video tutorial I need to watch. Exact Topic of the day that I had to read.\n\nOnce I learnt basic things best way forward was to have a precise App that I will build to keep learn and be on track.\n\nCreated lists for each screen. Whenever felt stuck in a bug or issue. I broke the list even more. Somedays I just had one task Crystal clear to Fix a bug and my mind was automatically focused on that. Things started working and I was finally able to complete the app.\n\n**Can't tell you the feeling and confidence it gave me.**\n\nApple store Link to the basic app I created if you want to check\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grocery-shopping-list-recipes/id1561754760](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grocery-shopping-list-recipes/id1561754760)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post": "# How to start working after you procrastinated the whole day\n\nIf you like the post, [check this](https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/what-is-procrastination-and-why-we-do-it)\n\n*\u201cI\u2019ve been procrastinating the whole day.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything today, I\u2019m such a loser.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cNothing done, again. Why do I always end up watching YouTube videos?\u201d*\n\nAll of us have experienced a day when we\u2019re surfing the internet the whole day instead of doing something productive.\n\nLet\u2019s say it\u2019s already late afternoon,\u00a0**what are you going to do?**\n\nMost of us, if there isn\u2019t any scary deadline looming close,\u00a0**say \u201cwhat the hell, might as well continue\u201d** **and waste the rest of the day.**\n\nIt\u2019s called the\u00a0**What The Hell effect**.\n\nThe best example of it is when people diet.\n\nThey eat healthy for some time, but then they slip. They eat a donut or drink soda.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d and then they go on binge eating streak.\n\nThis is binary thinking - 0 or 1. I was eating healthy (at 1), but then I failed by eating something unhealthy, I\u2019m at 0 and whatever I do now doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nBut it does matter. After the binge is over, regret and low self-esteem flood in.\n\nAnd it works the same with productivity. I haven\u2019t done anything yet, therefore I\u2019m 0, I\u2019m a loser. You can also hear: I don\u2019t have enough time to do something now or I\u2019m already tired. Might as well finish that TV series.\n\n**Why do we let ourselves get away with doing this?**\n\nBecause\u00a0**we love resets**: starting tomorrow, starting next week or starting on the New Year.\n\nAll these resets have something in common. They\u2019re in the future and we naively think this time it\u2019ll be different.\n\nCan it work? Kind of. Some people can really change their lives by resetting. But simply remember how gyms are full at the beginning of January and how soon they empty out.\n\nAlso, this concept of reset has still the same glitch.\u00a0**The Binary Thinking**. When you don\u2019t go to the gym once, you failed, you\u2019re a loser now, again.\n\n**Because resets fail most of the time, we shouldn\u2019t bet on them.**\n\nWhat to do instead?\n\n## Mindset Shift #1: Dump the Binary Thinking\n\nIt is possible to be at 1 or 0 but in most cases, it isn\u2019t worth it.\u00a0**We don\u2019t have to be perfect in our diet, productivity or life in general to move forward**.\n\n**When you eat a cookie, you aren\u2019t at 0.**\n\nIf you count that you eat 5 times per day that makes it 35 meals per week. You failed once out of 35 tries.\u00a0**That puts you at 0.97**. And you don\u2019t have to be 1 to be healthy anyway.\n\nIf you work 40 hours per week and you procrastinated the last 5 of them, you can still be at 0.875. You don\u2019t have to be productive every single waking hour anyway. Quality over quantity is what counts.\n\nAll of us fail once in a while and it\u2019s fine. It\u2018is human.\n\nThat also leads to...\n\n## Mindset Shift #2: You don\u2019t have to say What the Hell\n\nWhenever you realize that you\u2019re off track, you don\u2019t have to say what the hell.\n\nInstead,\u00a0**think about who was the one who wanted this goal**. It was\u00a0*you*.\n\nDo you still want it? If so, then acknowledge you failed a little bit.\u00a0**But if you want, you can still hit the target as closely as possible.**\u00a0To be 0.93 is better than 0. Even 0.5 is way better than 0.\n\nThat\u2019s it. It is such a small thing, but it can be life-changing. It works as a nice relief.\n\nWhat if you really don\u2019t want the goal? Then it is fine. All of us have some fake goals that are just wishes or dreams that we don\u2019t really want and we\u2019re faking it because of some internal or external pressures.\n\nWhen you realize something is a fake goal, please don\u2019t feel guilty about not pursuing it. Instead, find a goal you feel more motivated to pursue.\n\nOkay, now you have the correct mindset.\n\n## Let\u2019s finally get to work.\n\nIf you were surfing the internet all day, you\u2019ll notice that your mind is restless. You can\u2019t focus properly. You might want to quit immediately.\n\nThere are 2 possible ways how to solve it (combine them for the best results):\n\n## 1. Calm down\n\nThe best one to calm yourself down is to sit down on the chair for 5 minutes, turn off the screens, and just stare at the wall or close your eyes.\n\nBreathe. Take deep breaths. Or focus on your inhaling and exhaling.\n\nGet bored.\n\nOur brains are usually full of dopamine hits from the internet and we\u2019re overwhelmed. You know that feeling.\n\n## 2. Do the bare minimum\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to start because we\u2019re scared that it\u2019s the end of fun. Or you might be scared by the sheer amount of work or scale of the project ahead of you.\n\nThen make it less difficult or less scary:\n\nSet up a timer for 5 or 15 minutes and do a quick outline.\n\nTake a paper and a pencil and sketch out the first draft. Get the first quick and dirty version. Get from 0 to 0.1.\n\nOnce you\u2019re working, you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s easier to keep working then it was to start working. When you get into the work, you will become curious about the problems it entails and you can even start enjoying the work you\u2019re doing. You can get into the flow.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nWhen you realize you\u2019re failing to achieve your goal:\n\n**Shift your mindset**\n\n1. Realize it\u2019s not binary, you don\u2019t have to get to 1 (100%), 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 are all good.\n2. Don\u2019t say \u201cWhat the Hell,\u201d instead reflect on why you the goal is worth the effort for you\n\n**Take action**\n\n1. Take a step back and calm down. Let the restlessness go away.\n2. Start with the bare minimum. Do 5 minutes of work. Create a rough outline. Write the first paragraph.\n\nEven if your day didn\u2019t go according to your imagination (didn\u2019t get to 100%), it doesn\u2019t mean it has to end at 0% satisfaction and 100% regret.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope it helps. I heard about What The Hell effect a few months ago and I was trying to figure out how to stop screwing myself.

My biggest problem is, when i see something which is big to do, and far to finish, and until it finish there is no reward, my mind do everything in his possibility to avoid me getting to work. I can plan something for decades to come but starting them no.\n\nI m not at my top if life actually, but if my dreams i rule the world... Each time i tell fucking myself i should start doing the smallest things before having plans for mankind.\n\nSo my question is where do u guys find the motivation in long term ? When u know what u do will have consequences in years, not sure about the success, go through lot of steps... etc\n\nWhat about sport and alimentaion ? Does they really play a key role for the people who went from no sport at all and random alimentation to something well searched and organized ?\n\nI would like to have this life of the those people on social media that shows a healthy life style, with a beautiful appartement, good income, having experiences in life like trips etc, the worst comes when i see that some people gets educated since start to search for this type of life, like this is the best, u need to do that and that to get that etc, u see of what kind of people i m talking ? \n\nI mean this is an example between a lot but the point is that i m getting motivated after, and really fast i lose this motivation really fast.\n\nI also have troubles to focus of my different objectives have too much...\n\nFor now this what i planned to do :\n\n\\- Reminder lock screen : I have a bloc notes where there is like 300 statements i do when i procrastinate, want to summarize them into short sentences i put on my background photo of my phone lock screen...\n\n\\- Using Trello : I put projets i want to do for my freelance work, with schedules and everything, and i add what i get if i do it.\n\nPlease share and comment as much as u like i accept everything don't hesitate !",

        "title": "I created a simple system to help motivate you to work when you're feeling like procrastinating.",
        "post": "I've created a productivity system, built around a simple Project Timer that intends to help you stop procrastinating and motivate you to work on your important projects more often.\n\nIt's called [Project Time Machines](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ticcc.ptm), available for\u00a0free (no ads)\u00a0on Google Play. A sign-up is required, but your info will not be shared or used for marketing. It's only for storing your data.\u00a0You can check out a tutorial from the login screen without creating an account.\u00a0\n\nHow it works:\n\n**Setup:**\n\n1. Open the app and tap **Start a Project**.\u00a0\n2. Enter a **Project Goal** and a **Goal Date**.\u00a0\n3. Change the **Project Start Date**, if you started before today.\u00a0\n\nSetup is complete.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\nThe next time you sit down, ready\u00a0to do some work on your project:\n\n1. Open the app\u00a0\n2. Tap your **Project Card** to open it\u00a0(there are screenshots on [my app listing in Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ticcc.ptm))\n3. Tap the **Start an Op** button (each of your work sessions is called an Operation, or Op).\u00a0\n4. Enter how long you'll work without breaks or interruptions (**Op Duration**)\u00a0\n5. A **Focus** window will be open. Enter a line or two about what you'll be working on right\u00a0now. This is to help you get into a focused mindset, and will help you to avoid distraction as you work.\u00a0\n6. Tap **Start**.\u00a0\n7. Work until time ends and the alarm sounds.\u00a0\n8. Tap Stop if you're done for now or want to take a break. Tap **Add Overtime** if you want to keep working and stop when you're ready.\u00a0\n9. When you're done, an **Actions Taken** window will be open. Enter a few lines\u00a0about what you worked on, and what you need to do next. Maybe enter a note about something you feel has affected your performance. You can enter as much or as little as you like.\u00a0\n10. Tap the **Op Score** icon and enter a score or grade for your performance for this Op. Use up to\u00a0any 3 characters you wish. If you use letter or number grades, your averages will be calculated.\n\nThat's about everything you need to do.\n\nThere's an option to add notes about **Roadblocks**, which are particular challenges or obstacles you may have encountered and\u00a0want to take note of. But otherwise, there's nothing else for you to enter, maintain, tag, organize, upkeep or otherwise fiddle with.\n\nSo, if there's almost no setup, and you barely\u00a0touch it for maybe a minute or two\u00a0whenever you work, how is this app supposed to help you stay productive?\n\nWell, the next time you're sitting in front of your computer screen, clicking and scrolling, knowing full well you're procrastinating, and you're\u00a0trying to find the discipline\u00a0to do even just a little work instead of wasting another evening staring at screens...\n\nIt is often in these moments, when your discipline is being tested, where your thoughts about work are foggy and your eyelids are heavy\u00a0and your bed and favorite TV show are calling... This is where you need your productivity system to step up and fuel your motivation and remind you of what's important.\n\nSo, Project Time Machines suggests that next time you're feeling conflicted between doing a little work or just going to bed,\u00a0 do not rely solely on your will power or inner strength to get you moving.\n\nYou now only need to make the very small commitment to open the app and review your progress. You can decide in a minute if you want to work or not.\n\nSo you will open your PTM,\u00a0 and at the top of the home screen you'll see your\u00a0Project Card.\n\nIn the upper-left is a box titled\u00a0**Days Since Last Worked**.\n\nMaintaining\u00a0a streak of working many days in a row without skipping is a popular motivation method discussed here often. I see it mostly attributed to [Jerry Seinfeld's don't-break-the-chain technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/144ad8/jerry_seinfelds_dontbreakthechain_technique_more/).\n\nIf you can keep a zero in the Days Since Last Worked box for long stretches, that's impressive. I find keeping long streaks difficult - but I try to keep from ever going beyond 3 days without doing some work on my Project.\n\nHaving an accurate reminder of how long you've been slacking really helps to keep long breaks from getting out of hand.\n\nIn the middle-bottom of the Project Card is your **Total Time Worked**.\n\nThis number only accounts for the time you were working, fully focused. It does not account for breaks, interruptions or\u00a0when you allow yourself to become distracted (this is tracked separately by the **Lost Time** timer).\n\nEach time I look at this number, I'm always surprised at how much time I actually worked compared to how much I feel like I've worked. I suppose it's because I'm so often thinking about my project that it feels like I'm doing more than I really am. Having this accurate total so easily available and basically unavoidable when opening the app, is a solid reminder that there is are lot of available\u00a0hours in the day\u00a0that clearly aren't being spent taking action.\n\nThe very next features I intend to add to the app are being able to see totals for specifically chosen time periods, so I can try to improve my Total Time Worked from week to week or month to month.\n\nAlso on your Project Card is your **Project Goal** and **Goal Date**, which you entered the first time you opened the app.\n\nI'm sure you've heard the recommendation to write down your goals where you can see them. Maybe you've been told to put them on your bathroom mirror, or on your nightstand so you can see them a couple times a day.\n\nWith Project Time Machines, you'll be looking at your goals just at the moment you're most inclined to do something about them! You're at a moment where you're looking for the motivation to stop wasting time and do some work. What better time to be reminded in writing about the project that's most important to you, and to see that your goal date is approaching faster than your Time Worked is climbing.\n\nMaybe now you're beginning to feel the motivation building, but then the procrastination center of your brain will make one final attempt to knock your ass down and tell you that work can wait till tomorrow. It'll tell you, \"You don't even know what you've got to work on next.\"\n\nLots of times, even if I have a solid to-do list I'm working from, I can still feel overwhelmed\u00a0by how much there seems to do and I'll feel unclear and uncertain about what I should do next. And this feeling of fogginess is often enough to discourage me from getting started.\n\nThe **Actions Taken** screen, which I described above in Step 9 above, aims to help with this problem.\u00a0With one tap, you will instantly be able to review what you worked on last, for any specific day or part of the project you've worked on.\n\nIf you jump around between smaller steps within your project, or if you just tend to wander away from working for a while, this will help you to not lose track of where you left off or what you've accomplished, even after an extensive break.\n\nSo, now the next time you're feeling like you're procrastinating and need help snapping out of it,\u00a0open the app and do\u00a0a quick review.\u00a0\n\nAre you putting in the time required to make real progress? Are you working as often as you\u00a0like,\u00a0or know you should or could be? Are you still on track for reaching your Goal Date? Do you know where you left off, and what you\u00a0could be working on right now?\n\nAre you motivated enough to do maybe a half-hour work and keep your streak going and keep your project idea alive, growing and moving forward?\n\nThat is what my app [Project Time Machines](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ticcc.ptm) aims to help you with.\u00a0\n\nIf it does help, I'd love to hear about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nEdit:  I really don't know how to express how grateful and humbled I am by the response and the feedback you've given me today. I have been working on this app for a very, very long time, and today, you made it real. Thank you so much.\n\nSo, it looks like I have some new Op Objectives to get started on! I'm so excited to be able to continue to develop this app, now that I'm not the only user anymore!\n\nIf you're trying it out and have any questions or suggestions, you can reach me at support at projecttimemachines dot com.\n\nAnd if you are using it and find it helpful, a review on the Google Play listing would literally be the most helpful thing you could do for me and this app right now, and would be so appreciated.\n\nThank you again, very much.",

Stop the distraction, and expose the bordem, and emotions that come with it.\n\nAnd once you do, i guess your going to start having crazy withdrawl symptoms, don't cave, this is so important.

        "post": "# My Struggles!\n\nHey everyone, I\u2019m a founder with ADHD. Building habits is challenging but so important when it comes to saving time and living your ideal life. When I had bad habits, I ultimately lived on autopilot, and my days went by according to whatever my mind wanted. I was a hostage to my mind and not intentional with my time. I\u2019d squander my time by\n\n* Getting distracted and avoiding tasks,\n* Thinking about what I needed to do instead of doing it,\n* Looking for things because I misplaced or lost them,\n* Redoing things because I couldn\u2019t understand my notes or forgot I did it,\n* Putting out fires because I forgot to prepare or didn\u2019t do something\n* Spending an hour on a task that should have taken 5 mins\n\nMost of my time was spent accounting for my bad habits instead of propelling me forward. Bad habits generated problems, slowed me down, and built time debt. On top of that, habits compound with time and become harder to unlearn. Luckily, good habits work in the inverse. By building good habits, I save time, solve future problems and enable myself to achieve more. Plus, I was able to learn other habits faster. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to unlearn and fill bad habits with good ones. Learning to build strong habits ultimately allowed me to stop taking medication and overcome my ADHD. Here\u2019s how I did it!\n\n# How I started to build habits!\n\nAfter 6 months of struggling with my first job, I started reading a few books to learn more about myself and how to overcome my ADHD. The two books that helped me the most were Deep Work and Driven to Distraction. Driven to Distraction helped me with accepting my ADHD. Deep Work gave me the framework to use my time effectively. Here are the key learnings from Deep work:\n\n* If I want to improve, I have to measure myself\n* Focus on impacting my actions rather than the results\u00a0\n* Review my actions & results regularly and make adjustments\n* Give myself time limits by timeboxing tasks otherwise I\u2019ll waste my time\n* Give myself deadlines to generate urgency and create pressure\n* Don\u2019t let my phone blow my time\n\nAfter learning these insights, I started implementing these learnings and making improvements. I started with a couple of easy habits and did them daily. Here are a few things I did:\n\n* Make my bed every morning \u2192 I had to build the habit of consistency first. I started with an easy habit and let it carry me into other habits.\n* Review my day \u2192 Reviewing my day helped me assess my day, identify improvements, and iterate on my solutions.\n* Started using a progress tracker to ensure I was growing\n\nThis allowed me to create an easy feedback loop to ensure I was getting things done, and when I was missing the mark, I knew quickly. When I was missing the mark, I iterated and tried something new.\u00a0\n\n# How I implement my learnings!\n\nA book that summarizes a lot of my learnings is Atomic Habits. It breaks down how to lower the activation energy to form new habits. The key things that they reference are\n\n1. Make things obvious\u00a0\n2. Make things attractive and desirable\n3. Make things easy to do\n4. Make it rewarding\n\nFor example, here\u2019s how I\u2019m implementing these learnings for my coding journey:\n\n1. Send myself a text message to remind myself I have to code\n2. Remind me of the reward (DJ turntables) I promised myself if I complete my task\n3. Follow along with the Odin Project during my allotted time for programming in the morning when I have nothing else to do and have energy\n4. Reward me daily with affirmations, and monthly with a tangible reward (DJ turntables)",

This is mostly due to difficult circumstances and not laziness or procrastination (maybe a bit). Anyhow, I know I\u2019ve fucked up, I know I\u2019m in deep shit: how do I get out of this one??!\n\nI am willing to do whatever it takes for the next 7 days to retain as much information and study as hard as possible. My memory pretty good so I\u2019ll only need to look over the material once to capture 85-90% of it.\nSome have suggested sleeping 4 hours on 4 hours off; some have suggested taking drugs. I want to do this drastically but not chemically abusing anything and sticking to a (relatively) normal sleep schedule.\n\nIs there any productivity hacks or things I should be doing to pull of the absolute impossible and get decent marks in my final exams? I really hope you guys can come up with something, thank you so much!!\n\nedit: I don\u2019t need help with attention span or anything, I can work hard but I need to know how to work harder.",

        "post": "I experienced procrastination the most during my university years. It seems high school and university students are still facing this challenge the most. When I browse through reddit, it\u2019s astonishing how severe this problem is for many of them.\u00a0\n\nLooking back to my university years, I can understand what was going on and why procrastination was such a big problem for me.\u00a0 **I** **simply** **had too much time to get my tasks done.** Yeap. You heard it. I had too much time to complete my homework or to prepare for my exams. I had the luxury of time. And **I could afford to spend time on procrastination.** But of course, back then I thought that I was busy. I worked part time since the second year of university. I always had a job on a side. I thought I was busy with school and with work. But in reality, I was not. I gave myself too much time to get things done.\u00a0\n\nI realized I only had a problem of procrastination when I was doing homework. Guess what, **I had zero procrastination during the exam time**. You remember what I\u2019m talking about. You walk into this huge auditorium; they sit you down and give you an exam booklet. Then they start the countdown. Sometimes it\u2019s a big clock. Sometimes they write the time on a board. But you see that you only have 2 or 3 hours to get this exam done.\n\n**And never in my life did I see a student who struggled with procrastination during an exam.**\n\nEveryone starts writing the moment they say \u201cgo\u201d. These are the exact same students who\u2019ve been suffering from procrastination for the entire semester. Then they walk into this room and wow, their procrastination disease is cured. Why is that? Because they only have 2 hours to get this exam done. And they have no time to waste.\u00a0\n\n# Agile/SCRUM Teams\n\nThis is also the reason **why Agile and SCRUM became so popular in the tech world**. The team only has a short amount of time (called a sprint) to get major improvements done. In contrast, big corporations loooove long-term planning and long-term projects. They give themselves years to get stuff done. No wonder, they never meet the deadlines.\u00a0 **When you give yourself too much time, you have time to procrastinate. You have a lot of time to create a lot of drama about your work.**\u00a0All that overthinking, over-analyzing, over-researching. And the funny thing is even if we give ourselves a lot of time, we end up doing the task at the very end, in a very short period of time. The rest of the time is spent on drama.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of **the Parkinson Law.** Work expands to fill the time allotted. If you think you can do a task in a week, you are right. If you think you can do this task in a day, you are also right.\u00a0\n\n# The State of Flow\n\nAbout two years ago, everyone wanted to reach the state of flow. This idea was first proposed in a book called \u201cFlow\u201d by the author with the last name noone can pronounce. Well only the lazy one wasn\u2019t talking about this book in their book reviews videos.\u00a0 And people tried to find different complicated ways to get to this magic state of flow.\u00a0 But you know what I\u2019ve found? **It is very easy to be in the state of flow when you give yourself little time to get your tasks done.** It works like crazy! All the inner chatter is gone the moment you realize that you only have an hour to write that blogpost or to prepare that report. Try it for yourself! It\u2019s free! And it\u2019s very effective.\u00a0\n\n# You Can Enjoy Your Life\n\nAnother amazing thing about giving yourself tight timelines is that you can actually enjoy your life. You have time available for leisure. For fun. For family and friends. And you don\u2019t need to think about all the tasks you should be doing because you got them done in the scheduled time block. Or you know that they are on your schedule and you will get them done tomorrow.\n\n# Time Blocking\n\nI recommend scheduling your tasks in 30-minute increments. Some tasks might take longer. I wouldn\u2019t recommend anything longer than 90 minutes. **Plan for the results, not the activities**. Instead of \"working on the blogpost\", put \u201cpublish a blogpost\u201d.\u00a0\n\nReducing the amount of time you give yourself to complete a task **helps with perfectionism**. If you know that you only have an hour to write and publish your blog post, you don\u2019t waste an hour on choosing the perfect cover image.\u00a0\n\nI also like that I don\u2019t have to keep thinking about my tasks. I know it\u2019s in my schedule, so **I don\u2019t need to have all the drama in my head** of how i\u2019m not good enough because I haven\u2019t completed these tasks yet. I know that they will get done when it\u2019s time to get them done. Why bother worrying about them now?\n\n# How to Start\n\nIf you are new to time blocking and scheduling, I recommend using the concept of **anchoring up**. It means, you need to have an external commitment to get your work done by a specific time. It\u2019s like having a deadline for your assignment back in university days. A professor always gives a specific time you should submit your assignment by. If you are a student, find a buddy.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a term paper to write. Agree that by Monday noon you will email each other your outlines. By Wednesday noon, you will email each other the literature review section. By Friday noon, you will write your introduction and conclusion. You get the idea. Break the major project down to the tasks that can be done in a few hours and create a deadline for those.\n\n**I recommend having a deadline at 12 pm**. You can get your most important task done in the morning and then enjoy the rest of your day guilt-free. Otherwise, you will spend an entire day anticipating this task and it\u2019s just not fun.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve used this approach in my grad school. And I was able to finish grad school one semester earlier. And I never did any school work past 4-5 pm. This stuff does work.\n\nOf course, this idea applies to everyone, not just students. Create not only a *date* deadline, create a *time* deadline for your task. *\u201cI will create and submit my quarterly report to my manager by 3 pm on Thursday.\u201d* And don\u2019t give yourself the luxury of time. **Time is only useful when you are resting and recharging. Giving yourself too much time on work or school stuff is never a good idea,** in my experience. It only leads to procrastination, useless perfectionism, drama, and confusion.\u00a0\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you procrastinate doing something, it\u2019s probably because you gave yourself too much time. Or too much ambiguity. Break your tasks down into 30 to 60-minute increments. Put them on your schedule. Plan for the results you will produce in that 30- or 60-minute interval. And be done with these tasks when the time is up. **It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. It** **just** **needs to** **be done.**\u00a0\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHope you guys found this useful!

On a normal weekday I wake up at 7:00 am, go to school at 7:30 am get home at 3:00 pm, waste 5 hours on youtube/youtube shorts, then eat with family 8-9 pm, and waste another 1-2 hours on youtube/youtube shorts, then I sleep stressed because I did no homework. (I said YouTube a lot because usually, this is what I waste my time on.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, if you did read the schedule above you probably read \"5 hours of YouTube.\" Yup, I tend to always procrastinate when I come back home and \"try\" to work. I tried going to the library, and it worked. The problem was I had a limited time of 2 hours on the computer and sometimes the library is closed. So other than the library solution, do you guys have any advice to stay motivated to do my work? I keep blocking websites that distract me but then I tend to open them on another email, or on the TV, or on guest mode, etc. Meaning for some reason one way or another, I tend to reach the distracting website. I tried to think of \"Why do I want to finish my work\" to keep me motivated. But that was just a thought. Furthermore, I wanted to say that most of the time I do go on YouTube it's because of my environment, my boredom, me being uninterested in the homework, and the HUGE stress because the work feels like a mountain that I need to climb (especially now that it had already started to pile up). Also, by environment I mean I am either studying around my family which sometimes helps sometimes not, or I am studying in my room alone. Please could someone give me at least one piece of advice that will 100% fix my problem? \ud83d\ude2d ",

I would break down sobbing when losing a single mark, not understanding the homework made me panic, and being in school i seriously feared going home because it meant i had to go back to forcing myself to study for the entire day, and being at home made me fear going back to school because it meant more teachers to impress, and learning more which means more i need to study. There was even a month period where the entire time my body felt like it was teetering on edge, like it was ready to spring and run at any sign of \"danger\", which was incredibly draining and only added to the awful feeling i was experiencing all the time.\n\nEver since then, i found my focus started to slip, my motivation fell to rock bottom and i didn't care about my grades anymore. Even now, these things ring true. But a big issue i found was the prospect of sitting down to study instilled major fear in me. I keep putting off doing homework, studying, even reading chapters, which as you expected still stresses me out.\n\nPlanning, scheduling, etc didn't help. \"Just one hour, you can do it!\" Didn't help either. I think a major reason for that is because during the 8th-9th-10th grade period when i actually attempted to study, i found my studying got slower and it took me forever to study anything. I'd spend over 7 hours a day staring at a textbook and barely finish the first (and most simple) chapter. So that meant i had to spend entire days to study a small amount of information rather than doing things i actually deemed important and mattered to me, or even enjoyable things. And to me there was no way i was doing that, im not spending 10+ hours a day trying to trudge through information only to finish less than a quarter of it, and even when i try to schedule time blocks to study things (5 hours for this one chapter!) Im never able to stick to it, never even remotely finishing in time (or at all) which made me lose trust in myself.\n\nSo i think majorly because of that, the thought of starting (and in the very rare times i actually sit down to study) i feel incredibly anxious. It feels like sitting down to study is basically forcing myself to once again repeat the 8th grade by spending the entire day studying without so muchas break just so i can keep up, despite being in college now, i still cant shake this constant feeling. Even actually sitting down to study just makes me think about how none of this is sticking to my brain and my memory is awful and how ill have to spend hours just trying to rote memorise this information because i can't remember it right now...etc\n\nI can't really go to a counseller either, and my family isn't much help at all (i tried explaining many times, they just never get it and it goes in from one ear and out the other). So im a kinda along on this. I want to study again, i know I'll feel much better if im just able to study, i just don't want to trudge through hours and hours of it per day, barely making any headway and stressing about all the things i could be doing instead (like practicing skills, hobbies, languages....), even rewarding myself doesn't work, something as simple as \"Okay, if you finish this you can get 30 minutes break!\" Or \"You can play this game after you finish\" just don't do anything for me. Honestly i even want to study right now, and partially wrote this to try and put it all into words and think it through.\n\nAny advice?",

I'd work till 12am with a few breaks in between (dinner/talking to flatmates/chores) but at the end of the day I'd have 3-4 more hours worth of work left. Then I'm left contemplating whether to sacrifice sleep and prioritize the remaining work, or prioritize sleep which ends up with me being behind on work the next day, This leaves me in a never ending cycle of either having too less sleep, being behind on work, or even both (because with less sleep I cannot focus in lectures). How do I manage to break out of this cycle so that I can even be ahead of schedule with lectures and syllabus and how long will that take. Right now I am clueless in lectures since I don't have the time to prepare for them beforehand. What steps do I take to somehow sleep well and be able to catch up on work while providing 1-2 hours of time at the gym 3 times a week.",

I'm usually a scheduled person (I keep a schedule in my head but I don't write it down) and do the same things everyday and get stuff done. This, however, changed when I began my Junior year of high school and I started having to take notes on AP US History.\n\nAt first, I had to take pages upon pages of outlining the American Pageant textbook which, at first, made me sleep till 3 AM or 2 AM (usually like 3-4 hours of working) nearly every night for the first 2-3 weeks. And then overtime, I started not to feel like doing it. I split my work evenly across days (I also did them in weekends) and they went swell until on certain days, I just did NOT want to do it. I'd get distracted, stressed, or wanted to do something other than that. \n\nMy teacher got changed and this new teacher had a different approached to taking notes. He gave a packet instead with fill-in notes (the AMSCO reading guides) and I felt fine with it. It seemed a lot easier than the different approach of the previous teacher's and it took 30 min to 2 hours to complete. I divided my work evenly and then the same thing happened: I worked swell at first and then on certain days I just didn't feel like doing it. I'd get frustrated and then put it off until tomorrow and then do it all that day. I can't tell if I'm procrastinating or if I have a good work ethic.   \n\n\nI came up with a new solution: I could just work on it during class when I had the free time to. It worked **very** effectively at first and I would get the work done even *before* I got back home. I would slowly not feel like doing it as well during school but I'd still try to get it done.  \n\n\nIt's the weekend now and I'm trying to do my work but I'm just so stressed about it. I feel like even *if* I get it done, I'd still feel stressed about tomorrow's work.   \n\n\nI'm a pretty conscientious person so I just can not mentally feel \"rested\" until I have the work done. When I put off work for a certain day, I just feel like crap when I wake up the next day. I feel like I'm too dutiful to be a procrastinator in comparison to my procrastinator friends but I also feel too lazy to be a perfectionist.   \n\n\nTips and analysis on problems are greatly appreciated.",

        "post": "So, yesterday's post talked about getting out of a rut. If you're working to employ some of those techniques, it'll ideally be a while before you're back at full capacity. However, during that time, you may find yourself hindered by procrastination. So, in preparation for that, let's discuss the tried and tested ways to beat procrastination.\n\nUs humans are very counter-intuitive creatures. When we're feeling down, and someone asks how we're doing, we say we're fine. When the waiter tells us to enjoy our food, we say \"you too\" and then think about it every night until the relief of death. And when we have an important task to do, we offload it to our future selves.\n\nIt's not like we're genuinely tricked by that silver-tongued charlatan, Procrastination. We know that putting off the task is going to hurt us in the long run. Obviously, browsing Reddit is intrinsically more interesting than doing your taxes, but that's not *really* why we're risking tax evasion. Procrastination is much deeper than just not wanting to do a tedious task.\n\n## WHY WE DON'T DO THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO\n\nResearch in the past has found that there are 7 main reasons for procrastination:\n\n1. **It's boring.** The task we're given isn't mentally stimulating enough. Folding the laundry doesn't get the heart racing quite as much as clutching out a victory in your favorite video game. (I don't have a source for this, but I hope you can take my word for it).\n2. **It's frustrating.** It's not that it's hard, it's just annoying. You know you should go to the gym, but you always feel like you work so hard and never see progress. \n3. **It's difficult.** Okay, this time, it is hard. The grass in your lawn has grown so tall that four neighborhood kids have become lost in there in the past month. And you're not ready for 3 hours in the sun with a push mower.\n4. **It's ambiguous and confusing.** You're not really sure how to complete the task. You have an essay due in two days, and the topic is *True or False: Explain the Economic Factors that Led to the Production of the movie Titanic*. What?\n5. **It lacks structure.** You have no idea where to start or how any of these pieces fit together. It's like having to complete a jigsaw puzzle after running the entire thing through a food processor. \n6. **It's not intrinsically rewarding.** Some tasks are rewarding by themselves. At the very least, there's a natural reward at the end. Your assignment? None of that.\n7. **It lacks personal meaning.**  Sure, you could look into why your check engine light started flashing a couple of days ago. But designing a logo for your new business sounds much more appealing.\n\nThis is still just the surface level of procrastination, though. These reasons are what we tell ourselves to justify our inaction. It's not a result of time-management, but instead a symptom of insufficient emotional regulation. New research has found that we put off tasks that have hidden stressors. We may be anxious about the outcome or just concerned about feeling any of the negative ways listed above.\n\nSo how do we stop it? First, we need to look at the Procrastination Cycle, which is more than just an alternative name for a unicycle. \n\nThe cycle starts with us not doing anything. As a result, we feel anxious and guilty. This allows self-doubt to creep in, and that doubt ultimately gives rise to a feeling of helplessness. Since we feel helpless, we don't do anything. And the cycle repeats and repeats until you're up at 2AM trying desperately to do what you should've four weeks ago. Luckily, we can break the loop regardless of what step we're currently on.\n\n## \"I DON'T DO ANYTHING\": HOW TO END THE INACTION\n\nIf you're starting the Procrastination Cycle anew with a fresh assignment, then it's imperative that you immediately identify why you're putting things off. If that's the case, all you need to remember is STRESS. (That's an acronym, I'm not telling you that panic is the solution). \n\n**S** \\- Steps: Your next step, whether it's your first step or not, is creating a roadblock. Maybe it's too advanced or placed too early in the sequence. Find a more specific and practical next step to take.\n\n**T** \\- Thinking: You need to reassess your thought patterns, more specifically, the way you're talking to yourself. Negative self-talk drains your resilience and beats you down. Instead of \"I'm so lazy for not starting this yet\", try, \"What do I need in order to be ready to start now?\". \n\n**R** \\- Research: Sometimes, you might just lack the necessary information to get started. Do some more research to help you get started. Importantly, list out everything you need to know *before* you start researching. If you don't, you could get stuck in a cycle of analysis paralysis. (This occurs when you get stuck in a pattern of investigative inquiry and never actually start on the project). \n\n**E** \\- Emotions: An emotional boundary is hindering your progress. This may be related to something from your past. If possible, work through this in therapy, or try to find someone else who can take charge of this portion of the assignment. If those options are not available, pair the step with something that creates positive emotions. \n\n**S** \\- Sensory: Sensory overload occurs when our body processes too many external stimuli through our sensory organs. Have you ever been trying to study, but you were unfathomably irritated by the *sheer existence* of the person next to you? (Or, more specifically, the way they're breathing, tapping their toe, or the way they're writing). This excessive irritability is often a sign of sensory overload. If it's happening to you, find a way to mute some sensory aspects of the assignment.\n\n**S** \\- Self-Care: When all else fails, you may just need to tend to some of the biological fundamentals. Make sure your sleep, hunger, hydration, and socialization are all in check. Ensure that you feel safe and healthy in your environment.\n\nOnce you get yourself started, it's essential to not overwork (even if you feel that you can). When we're on a roll, it's easy to keep pushing forward and lose track of time. It's not until we regain a sense of lucidity that we realize the entire day has come and gone. Looking back on this the next day makes it much more challenging to start up again. Instead, schedule work and break periods.\n\nSome research has highlighted the significance of 90-minute work intervals, followed by a restorative 15-20 minute break. But, don't just use your 15-20 minutes to see how deeply you can conceal yourself in the cushions of your couch. This kind of activity helps us to relax. If you're planning on going into another 90-minute interval, instead make sure you're *recharging* on your break. Call a friend, eat your favorite food, or take a walk. If you really feel that you need to watch TV, watch something funny while walking around. \n\nIf 90 minutes feels too long, some research has reportedly highlighted the effectiveness of a work-to-break ratio of 52:17. You may need to experiment to find where in the 50-90 minute work interval works best for you.\n\n## \"I FEEL ANXIOUS\": RESOLVING THE EMOTIONAL HANG-UP\n\nYeah, emotions are essential and a necessary part of life, *but at what cost*. *They're interfering with my work*.\n\nAs mentioned before, it's often the hidden anxieties of an assignment that cause us to procrastinate. In fact, research has found that the amygdala, a structure in the brain responsible for fear and other \"negative\" emotions, is larger in chronic procrastinators. Procrastination can then be seen as your emotional limbic brain winning out over your rational pre-frontal cortex. (This is why practices that calm the limbic system, such as walks in nature or meditation, can also help alleviate procrastination). A similar study has found a technique known as *Inquiry-Based Stress Reduction* (IBSR) to be astonishingly potent in its ability to decrease anxiety and procrastination. This image shows the questions involved in the process.\n\nFirst, begin by asking yourself questions 1 and 2. Following this, use the open-ended questions listed under Q3 to create a mental representation of your stress. This will help you describe the emotions, sensations, effects, functionality, benefits, and causes of the thought. Take your time with this section. Following this, envision a version of yourself that exists without this thought. Finally, directly challenge the mental distortion by identifying three opposing views. Vitally, find specific evidence for each of these new beliefs.\n\nIn the study, participants were also given a journal to record stressful thoughts for the following week. In each incidence, they would use the same IBSR method presented above. \n\nIn conjunction with this, you can implement your own exposure routine. Essentially, you'll be performing your own CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). In CBT, invalid thought patterns are challenged with a line of questioning. (This is the \"cognitive\" portion). Following this, participants are run through an exposure hierarchy, which is the behavioral portion. This hierarchy ranks stressful situations from minimal pressure to maximum anxiety. Starting easy, the participant slowly progresses up the ladder and learns that the stressful circumstances are, in reality, tolerable. In terms of procrastination, you may start by simply writing a title for your paper. The next day, maybe you'll do five minutes of research. Next, you could write a paragraph. The goal is to gradually do more and more so that you can prove to yourself that there's nothing to be anxious about.\n\n## \"I DOUBT MYSELF\": GENERATING CONFIDENCE\n\nHabitual anxious thoughts have a tendency to instill self-doubt deep within us. Imagine anxiety as a deeply psychotic painter. (Bear with me on this). Seeking to revolutionize the art world, this painter decides that *you* are to be their new canvas. Every half an hour, they run up to you and put a paper cup full of pink paint on your desk. They light a firecracker and throw it in. When it detonates, you get spatters of pink paint all over you.\n\nFor whatever reason, you decide *against* calling the cops on this lunatic. (Maybe you missed your morning coffee, and this is keeping you awake, who knows). Every 30 minutes, without fail, you find more and more pink paint on you. At some point, you no longer consider yourself to be covered in pinks spots. At some point, you *are* pink. When your anxious thoughts keep telling you that there are reasons to be nervous, eventually, your brain works to justify that by finding reasons to believe it. More often than not, this comes in as self-doubt. Why else would you be nervous unless you couldn't do it?\n\nIf you find yourself at this point, reframing the situation is going to be your best friend. Starting as internally as possible, change your self-talk about your identity. Rather than tell yourself that you're lazy or incompetent, tell yourself that you're the kind of person who is driven and chases after their goals. A similar strategy has been found to be effective in fighting addiction. Regular smokers have fewer urges when they tell themselves, \"I'm not a smoker\" as opposed to \"I'm trying to quit\". Next, rephrase your emotional outlook. When we procrastinate, we often justify it because we'd feel bored by the task. As we've discussed, this is more often a problem of fear. Ask yourself what you're afraid of. Motivation is inherently found in facing our fears. Finally, shift the blame from you (*It's my fault I haven't started this yet*) to the problem at hand (*This is a challenging project; how can I make it easier?*).\n\nIt may also help to know that knowing when a task will end makes us perform better. If your procrastination is based on doubt about your ability, find a way to quantify your process. If you know that you need to type 5,000 words, this is easy. You can easily see your percentage of progress towards your goal. If your task is more abstract, you may need to get more creative. Knowing how far along you are makes continued focus less costly to the brain. Keep the end in sight, and your performance and energy will increase. \n\n## \"I FEEL HELPLESS\": EMPOWERING YOURSELF\n\nWhen self doubt persists for long enough, we fall into the trap of *learned helplessness*. It's a psychological phenomenon that's basically the emotional manifestation of an Adele album: *I've been hurt too much, and it's not worth trying*. It happens after a progressive series of disappointments and failures. It makes us feel as if we can't achieve even the smallest of goals.\n\nAs a result, we often seek to escape learned helplessness in the most counter-productive way possible. After feeling like we can't get the most straightforward thing right, we set grandiose goals to prove ourselves wrong.\n\n\"I've always sucked at math, but this year I'm going to study and ace the class!\"\n\n\"I eat junk every single day. I'm going to diet and lose 20 pounds!\"\n\n\"I've never taken a leadership position, I'm going to conquer the world by force!\"\n\nBut you don't fix a papercut with a full-body cast. You fix it with a bandaid. Similarly, don't set a lofty goal. Instead, do the small thing first. Do one math problem. Skip dessert. Practice dictatorship on the small island state of Nauru. \n\nSlowly build your momentum by showing yourself that you are capable. \n\nYou may also find it helpful to maintain momentum by intentionally stopping your work period at an unconventional point. Most of us, when working, tell ourselves things like *I'll stop once I finish writing this chapter,* or *I'll take a break when I finish organizing this closet*. This seems logical, but it also means that we return to a new start. Instead, stop in the middle of the process, making it easier to pick up and start immediately. \n\n## ACTION STEP\n\nProcrastination is an endless loop that let's anxiety take up far too much space in our minds. What're you putting off? I want you to set a timer for 10 minutes. When that timer goes off, do that thing that you're procrastinating for 90 seconds. That's it. If nothing else, it'll show you that it's probably not as bad as you thought.",

Exams are in next week and I didn't study on time and can't focus on studying because I can't control my emotions, blaming and hating myself and anxiety.\n\n\nSince I started going to college I could never manage my time properly. I was lazy, I procrastinated a lot and that screwed me up big time. All covid situation didn't help cuz i passed through 3 semester with online classes and exams. Yep.. almost didn't study at all. I cheated and asked for someone else's help. I can only think of Einstein's definition of insanity and I am actually insane. All the times I keep saying \"okay i passed this now I will study on time..\" and then I procrastinate again.\n\n\nThe fact that I am battling with porn addiction, I eat junk food and constantly looking at my screen whether it is video gamer or social media is making this even worse.\n\n\nNow my first exam is tomorrow and its Control Systems. Trying to study it, to learn it.. to understanding.. but the fact that some mathematic functions are being used that we studied last year and I didn't learn them is making this more and more difficult.\n\n\nNo.. I don't want to change to another course. I want to stay at engineering. I believe in destiny and all paths led me here. I just didn't do my part of thinking and working like an engineering student should.\n\nI seriously need help.. My pauses in studying are longer than studying itself since I can't keep studying for too long because I get mental blockade often.\n\nPast is past now.. I want to know what should I do for my near and distant future.

        "post": "TLDR: Sophomore ChemE reprioritizing his life.\n\nMy whole life I\u2019ve been a perfectionist in the area of academics. I\u2019ve got A\u2019s in every semester of my life, but I have not been a perfect perfectionist. A perfect perfectionist would display perfect marks resulting from perfect studying and perfect understanding. But I, I am an imperfect perfectionist. I appear perfect with my full-ride scholarship, 4.00 GPA, and REU offer. But in reality, my studying methods are flawed resulting in my understanding also being flawed. I just know how to do the least possible work for the most possible gain. I know how to play the game of getting a perfect GPA.\n\nI procrastinate starting an assignment until the last available moment to possibly not fail the assignment, then subsequently cram. I let distracting pleasures in the present, like watching videos, listening to music, hanging out with friends, delay or prevent my studying. I check my phone in a class several times, fragmenting my focus, scrambling my notes and my understanding. I check my phone in a day hundreds of times, interrupting the time that I\u2019m actually studying and making it so much more inefficient.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m not truly happy. I haven\u2019t been since I first started receiving grades in probably elementary school ten years ago because my practices have never balanced. I study a little, get my dopamine fix, then study again, and repeat again and again. Chasing the dragon of instant gratification by scrolling through social media, watching one short video that turns into a dozen, or watching a mini documentary because I figured I\u2019d watch a handful of shorter videos anyway, never ends with long term satisfaction.\n\nI\u2019m not sad though, I\u2019m not depressed, just a smidgeon less than halfway between sad and happy, but I know I could feel better. The stress and loneliness are bearable and are not yet a serious threat to my well-being. But I know they will be truly devastating to my well-being if I don\u2019t change. To become truly happy, I must develop and follow a routine that will balance my spirit, mind, and body.\n\nI want to be truly happy, not forever chasing quick pleasures while simultaneously dodging my responsibilities. I want self-confidence most of all, which I will only achieve with self-improvement of my spirit, mind, and body. I will make the time to meditate, read, and exercise. With my newfound self-confidence, I will be more expressive, smile more, have better eye contact, and just generally improve my personality. I will talk to more people, make more friends, speak well in public, and act comfortably with women; all four of these social achievements will further boost my confidence and improve my personality in a positive feedback loop.\n\nI will not let my grades determine my happiness. I will not try to finish the exam first in my class, I will not pull an all-nighter before an exam out of fear of failure because I procrastinated and barely actually studied, I will not immediately check my mark the instant grades are posted, I will not open the statistics and see how much better or worse I stacked up against my classmates. I will compare myself to who I was yesterday, and not to who others are today. I will seek personal academic betterment, not the illusion of perfection. I will study to the best of my ability without infringing on the other equally important aspects of my life. I will be satisfied when I am able to understand my material and also enjoy a life of reading, meditating, exercising, and participating in extracurriculars and hobbies. I will not be satisfied by an A, rather I will be satisfied when I know I made any improvement over yesterday.\n\nI will not be satisfied by my 4.00. For the two history essays I am writing now for my final exam, I would normally spend at least 12 hours on each one. Not anymore. I need to set an example for myself that it is okay to mess up and that the world and my future will not end if I don\u2019t appear perfect. I\u2019m going to write both in 6 hours, in half the time it would normally take me to write one essay. It will take forcibly demoting myself from a 4.00 to a 3.9something, from all As to one B, to kill my addiction to my 4.00, to force my mind to follow the path towards becoming a better student and person. I will be satisfied when my life is balanced.",

No one will probably care or read this but whatever lol. The point is, if you\u2019re pulling all-nighters to cram before a difficult exam, finish 15 homework assignments before the due date, dedicating 10 hours a day to study, etc. you may need to rethink your studying habits.\n\n**EVERYONE learns differently so keep that in mind as I describe myself. But, if we are similar, maybe this will work better for you.** I have good study habits and discipline from AP classes which is why the transition to college wasn\u2019t as drastic for me. I\u2019m really bad at understanding topics quickly, it takes effort on my own time outside of class to understand stuff. I\u2019m a good test taker when I feel comfortable with the material but I panic quickly if I\u2019m not. I do not work part time or partake in clubs, (Which I'm aware makes things a lot easier for me! But still, time management is key for everyone.) my free time is spent with friends/BF/family, doing stuff I like to do, and relaxing. My hands-on experience so far is from PT food industry job (3 years), 2 FT engineering internships (4 and 8 month), and class projects so I do not abandon everything else for grades!! This is important - hands-on experience is way more valuable than getting good grades. But still, you want to pass your classes!\n\n*What classes (undergrad and one graduate) I\u2019ve taken so far, not including required university-specific classes, labs or workshops (which is the same grade as the class):*\n\n* Dynamics (A-)\n* Physics E & M (B+)\n* Thermodynamics (B)\n* Calc 3 (the rest of the grades are As)\n* Differential Equations and Linear Algebra\n* Mathematical Methods for Engineering (Graduate)\n* Intro to Engineering 1 and 2\n* Chemistry\n* Statics\n* Mechanics of Materials\n* Material Science\n* Finite Element Analysis\n* Intro to Computer Science\n* 2 fluffy History Electives\n\n*What \u201cwent wrong\u201d:*\n\nThermo and E&amp;M: I Chegg\u2019d all of my homework without understanding it, didn\u2019t study efficiently,  didn\u2019t do enough practice before tests to understand concepts, all the tests went poorly. Took these in the same semester, they were my first non-A grades.\n\nDynamics: Didn\u2019t do enough practice before tests to understand concepts so I didn\u2019t feel comfortable on the midterms (but the final went great which is why I got an A- and not a B-something).\n\n*What works:*\n\nIt\u2019s important to figure this out because it helps a lot! Find out what type of learner you are and what things you need to be the most productive in. For me:\n\n* **ENVIRONMENT:** I work best in a quiet or silent place with no talking or annoying noises. I listen to lofi lyricless beats since I get easily distracted/annoyed by noises. If I\u2019m doing easy or light work, then I listen to a show or podcast. Time of day doesn\u2019t matter for me, I\u2019ll take what I can get, but I do prefer getting my work done in the morning.\n* **COLLABORATION:** I don\u2019t work/study well in groups because I tend to goof off, rely on others and not think as hard. Before passing in homework, I compare it with a friend or two that\u2019s in the same class that also finishes their homework early. We check for discrepancies then talk through them and if we can\u2019t figure it out, we go to office hours. I do light review sessions with a friend or two before exams to touch base and vent if needed. Having a friend or group in your classes is helpful for support (mentally and schoolwork-wise).\n* **PACE:** I like to study in longer sessions. Pomodoro doesn\u2019t work for me. I work until I feel like I need a break, maybe like 1-4 hours at a time, depending on the day. I take short breaks to rest my eyes a few times an hour. I like to walk around, shower (it\u2019s a good way to refresh yourself), nap, cook, eat, talk to friends, etc. on my breaks. I don\u2019t like watching videos or browsing social media because I tend to get sucked in. While I prefer to get all my work done in long sessions, I do use the time between classes if possible. These shorter sessions I use more for doing homework, rather than studying for a test.\n* **TOOLS:** I use a laptop (Macbook Pro) and tablet (iPad with an Apple Pencil) for all of my work. I keep everything electronic, I don\u2019t use any paper for work. I get PDF versions of textbooks, do homework electronically (printing out if necessary), scan my worksheets and do them, scan my tests, quizzes, etc. I have a digital bullet journal style planner and electronic calendar that I get notifications for.\n* **ROUTINE:** Get yourself in the habit of being productive! Set yourself up for success. On my dedicated work days, I have a whole early morning routine to get myself ready for a long day studying (big breakfast, pack lunch/snacks, shower, comfy outfit, at my favorite study spot by 9am). On normal days, I do work at basically the same time period and location whenever possible. Honestly, I really enjoy studying nowadays because it's so routine.\n\n*General tips:*\n\n* **Stay organized.** Have a planner, fill your calendar, whatever works for you.\n   * I have a digital planner and calendar on my iPad. EDIT: It is a bullet journal style planner I designed myself in GoodNotes5, and I use Google Calendar as well for notifications. Keep track of assignments due, test dates, quizzes, events, times you aren\u2019t going to do schoolwork, etc. Get in the habit of actually keeping your planner updated! Don\u2019t tell yourself you\u2019ll remember something and don\u2019t need to write it down.\n   * I have a monthly (test dates, lab dates, appointments, time away from school, etc) and weekly planner (everything!) that I keep updated.\n      * As soon as I get my syllabi, I update the monthly spread. Each week on Sunday, I update the weekly spread (with the monthly spread stuff as well as due dates for the week, plans for office hours, plans with friends, etc).\n      * Additionally, I include what tasks I\u2019ll do each day. For example, working on Homework 1 Tuesday, going to office hours Wednesday, finishing Homework 1 Thursday, due date Friday. This makes it easier to spread my workload out appropriately/realistically and to avoid rushing/cramming.\n      * When things get hectic, I\u2019ll fill out a daily (hourly) planner. This is a good way for me to make sure I\u2019m maintaining physical and mental health during stressful times.\n* **Have a \u201cperfectionist\u201d mindset.**\n   * Getting perfect grades isn\u2019t necessary, but having a perfectionist mindset helps you keep your standards high and allows for wiggle room. When you get a homework assignment, exam or quiz back, double check the grading. Sometimes graders DO mess up so you can get points back by bringing it to your professor\u2019s attention. Pay attention to how cascade failures are graded! Even if you get a good grade on something, just double check anyway. Keeping your grade as high as possible when it\u2019s within your control gives you more of a cushion when things get tough.\n   * Keep an Excel spreadsheet of your grades with accurate weight percentages. My school uses Blackboard but my professors don\u2019t factor in the different weights, so keeping track of my own helps me stay aware of my grades so I\u2019m not blindsided/surprised.\n* **Stay healthy, mentally and physically.** Keeping good physical health will help your mental health too. Get enough sleep, workout, eat healthy, all that. For mental health, don\u2019t forget to include time to relax, hang out with friends/family, do things you enjoy, etc. All of this WILL help you get better grades.\n* **Time management!** It allows you more time to relax and do things you want and a lot less time stressing out. Instead of wasting time procrastinating, why not be productive and then you can use your spare time to do that stuff without guilt?\n* If you manage your time and avoid procrastination, you should **never need to pull an all-nighter.** Getting some sleep (even if it\u2019s 3 hours) or taking short naps is way better than no sleep. Saving everything until the end and cramming instead of sleeping just isn\u2019t smart (mentally or physically), use the tips in this post to avoid that!\n* If you study, study, study with no positive results in your grades, **you are studying inefficiently.** I\u2019ve been there before; I convinced myself I was studying but I was really just listening to shows and scrolling on my phone in front of homework or wasting too much time on note-taking and textbook reading. Hopefully, the tips also help with this.\n\n*Different class structures:*\n\n* Class that focuses on lectures/slides that DON\u2019T get posted online\n   * Pay attention during these. Take notes, copy down as much as you can. Don\u2019t worry about organization or being neat, just focus on getting all the information accurately.\n* Class that focuses on lectures/slides that DO get posted online\n   * I tend to slack off during these, which isn\u2019t really recommended. I do mindless, easy work (like going through my planner, applying to jobs, stuff like that) in these classes while still listening to the lecture, and jot down any information not in the slides. I give my full attention when there\u2019s an example.\n* Class that focuses on going through examples\n   * Most important thing is getting the full example question and answer. Follow along with the professor as they\u2019re solving and explaining. If something doesn\u2019t make sense or you miss something, jot it down so you can mention it later.\n\n*How to approach homework:*\n\n* **Start early.** Start homework the day you get it because it will give you more time to learn, fix your mistakes, ask for help, etc.\n   * The day or soon after you get the homework, do all you can without referencing anyone else or Chegg answers. Don\u2019t spend too much time on tricky questions, just get as much done as you can. The purpose of this is to beat last minute procrastination and rushing, starting something is a good motivator to finish it up.\n   * Next, use your textbook as a reference to see if you can figure out more stuff. Write down relevant equations, tricks, bullet points, etc.\n   * Next, use Chegg or answer keys to work through stuff - READ THE EXPLANATIONS AND UNDERSTAND THEM. If the answers don\u2019t make sense, don\u2019t write it down.\n   * Finally, go to your professors or TA with questions, confirming if your work/understanding is correct, and finish your homework. Each prof is different so this is a good opportunity to connect and get a better feel of their methods, thought process, important points, etc.\n   * Optionally, discuss with friends - compare and talk through your answers without copying blindly. Since you\u2019ve been to office hours with questions, you\u2019ll be able to explain the answer to your friend with the same question. Explaining or walking through processes is a good way to solidify the information in your memory. If there are new questions, email or go to office hours again.\n* **Keep it neat.** It\u2019ll be easier for graders and easier for you when you\u2019re trying to reference it again in the future.\n   * If you need to do some scratch work or do some messy problem solving, do so on a whiteboard or scrap piece of paper. I like using tablets because I don\u2019t have to worry about erasing or wasting paper.\n   * Keeping your work neat also prevents silly mistakes like misreading or losing your train of thought.\n\n*How to approach studying for tests:*\n\n* **Start early.** Doing a little every day is easier than squeezing everything in one night. The days or week before a test should be spent doing review and practice, not trying to learn topics from scratch! The timeline depends on your current understanding of the test topics. I start the process at least a week before the exam.\n   * First step, figure out what topics/concepts are gonna be on the exam.\n   * Make a quick study guide of all the equations and notes you\u2019ll need to solve practice problems, so you\u2019ll spend less time digging around for them.\n   * Redo the homeworks\u2026from scratch! Don\u2019t tempt yourself by looking at your answers, really try to work through them. This is a great way to recall and solidify the information.\n   * Look back on your homeworks and list of topics to figure out what you do/don\u2019t need to work on.\n   * Work on your iffy topics. Do textbook questions, go to office hours, etc.\n   * Lastly, do the practice questions and tests your professor gave you for the exam. Go through and correct your mistakes, then work on those.\n   * Optionally, make a panic sheet (or cheat sheet if you\u2019re allowed) which is a concise sheet of paper with the essentials.\n* **How to approach practice questions:**\n   * For complicated questions, write out and explain each step. This is a good way to solidify the material and you can reference back to it if you forget how to solve similar examples.\n   * Don\u2019t waste your practice questions by giving up immediately and looking at the answers! Start from least to most relevant to your exam so you utilize the questions to the fullest potential.\n   * PRACTICE UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS! If you can't do it on your own, you're not going to be able to during a stressful exam.\n* **How to approach practice tests:**\n   * Save these for 1-2 days before the exam. Especially if you\u2019re only given one practice test, save it for the very end.\n   * Try to make your environment as close to the real thing as possible. Eliminate distractions, set a timer to get a feel of how fast you\u2019ll need to work, do the whole test in one sitting.\n   * Check your answers and figure out what you did wrong. Mark your mistakes like a grader would. Focus on practice examples as these mistakes while you\u2019re studying.\n\n# Not sure what else to include, so if you have any other questions, feel free to comment or message me.",

        "title": "Blanking on CS exams despite endless studying",
        "post": "CS undergrad here, please point me in the right direction if this isn\u2019t the place to ask for advice. \n\nI\u2019m having trouble with my CS exams, specifically my Data Structures and Algorithms ones, and it\u2019s become rather frustrating lately. I put in a lot of time and effort into studying for exams, and feel confident going into the test, but for some reason everything seems to fall apart during the exam. A lot of the exam questions ask me to find the runtime of some code, or to fill in skeleton code to mutate an ADT, or to write some code that fulfills the requirements given some interface, or to traverse a tree in some way given certain conditions, etc. When I practice such problems before the exam, I usually have a notion of where to start and manage to solve the problem within a reasonable amount of time. However, on the exam, I find myself not flustered or panicking, but blanking out when I see problems that ask me to write code for things I have never done before. For example, I knew how to rotate a 2D array and flip a 2D array, but a question on the exam asked me to shift a column down by x elements, and I completely blanked. Despite being solid on concepts, I find myself not being able to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d in time before time is up; my solution only popped up in my head as I was turning the exam in, and by this time it was too late for me to even write anything down for partial credit. \n\nSomething very similar happened last semester in my midterm exam, and I took it as bad luck. The same thing happened during the final exam last semester, and I noticed that I needed to make some changes because bad luck doesn\u2019t cause you to realize the solution only after you turn in the exam twice in a semester. I\u2019m a firm believer in the idea that I\u2019m not inherently smart, and that I can improve if I put in enough work. And so for my midterm exam this semester, I made sure to practice more and put my pride aside and went to office hours to ask for help whenever I didn\u2019t understand anything. Lo and behold, the same thing happened in this semester\u2019s midterm exam. I admit this frustrated me a lot because I felt like no matter how much work I put in, some external force (or even myself) was holding me back from doing well on the exams. I scored well on practice exams (past exams of previous offerings of the course), but for some reason the actual test would mess me up. After some reflection, I realized that the quantity of my efforts was not proportional to my performance on the exam, and because \u201cquality is better than quantity,\u201d I needed to change something up for another exam coming up soon.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is occurring because of my study habits, my environment/daily routine, or test conditions/nerves. I\u2019m convinced that the test conditions/nerves are not the main issue here, but I am not ruling them out as factors. During the exam, I become so engrossed in my work that I am not perturbed by any external forces (like people coughing or a tiny desk or whatnot). As for nerves, I am not anxious coming into a test, but I do have a sense of purpose in that I know that I have two hours to do a test that I want to do well on, and I have to not waste time in those two hours. \n\nHere are my study habits:\n\nI go to every lecture and take notes the following day to recap what I learned (taking notes during lecture distracts me). I also attend every discussion and lab section, and sometimes go to the extra practice sections held on weekends. When I can\u2019t make it to the extra sections, I do those worksheets on my own time since they are posted online along with their solutions. I do my best to attempt every problem myself without looking at the solutions, even if it takes me up to two days to figure out. At that point, I have to ask for help and go to office hours with either the professor or TAs to get a hint, and usually end up being able to solve the problem. Very rarely have I had to ask a TA for the full solution to a problem. \n\nI make it a point to start studying for an exam about 1.5-2 weeks before the test date. When I study, I go through my notes and rewatch lectures for any topics I am shaky on. If I still don\u2019t understand a concept, I seek help from a TA for clarification at office hours. If needed, I review homeworks and projects, though they aren\u2019t pertinent to the types of problems that will be on the exam. Conceptually, I feel like I have everything down at this point. From then on, I do all available practice worksheets on the course page (including ones from past offerings of the course), all practice problems from TA websites, and all available past exams of the course that are relevant. Same drill here; no looking at solutions until I am done, go to office hours to seek hints when I\u2019m stuck, compare my solution to the official solution to see what I could have done better. When doing past exams, I go to the library and time myself to simulate exam conditions. My professor allows us to bring a sheet of handwritten notes to the exam, so I usually fill this sheet up with a summary of every concept with examples (in case I blank out) and all of the things that I learned from my mistakes from the practice problems/exams. If I have extra space, which I usually do, I include some of the trickier problems from past exams in hopes that something similar shows up in the exam I\u2019m about to take.\n\nMy daily routine:\n\nI usually get ~7 hours of sleep (~2AM - 9AM), skip breakfast, go to class for 1-2 hours, go for lunch between 11AM-1PM, more class until 3PM-5PM, study until 7-8PM, get dinner, study more or go to the gym to play pickup if I have time. I try to go to the gym every day, but leading up to the exam, I only go play maybe twice a week. I don\u2019t take naps since it messes up my sleep schedule and I usually start my work the day it\u2019s assigned and turn it in before the deadline to avoid procrastination.\n\nLeading up to an exam I also log off all social media (only message people when needed) to prevent distractions. I don\u2019t watch much TV either so that isn\u2019t a problem for me. On the day of the exam, I make it a point to get 8-10 hours of sleep, though this doesn\u2019t always happen in my favor. I try to have a lax day in that I take my time for everything, whether it\u2019s getting to class or my morning routine or whatnot, as to not increase my stress for that day. I eat before the exam and try to get there 15 minutes early to get settled.\n\nSome things I believe may be part of my problem:\n\n- Sleep. On the weekends I feel well-rested when I get at least 10 hours of sleep. On weekdays I can typically function on ~7 hours, but sincerely wish I got more because I feel much better with at least 8 or 9 hours of sleep. I usually finish my work around midnight or 1AM, but end up staying awake trying to sleep due to noisy roommates/bright lights. This is an issue I\u2019m working on since it may be a long-term factor in the days leading up to my exam and my ability to \u201cconnect the dots.\u201d\n\n- Exercise. Although I try to go to the gym every day, I often don\u2019t in the two weeks before an exam because I\u2019m busy devoting every waking moment to practicing for the test. This may be causing me to burn out (even though I don\u2019t really feel burned out), but I read somewhere that exercising helps with memory retention. Not entirely sure about this.\n\n- Not attempting all ideas? When attempting to solve a problem on an exam, I find myself trying to walk through an idea for an approach I have in my head. If I deem it unsafe or unreasonable, I drop the idea and move onto another approach I can think of in my head. I believe this is because my mind is more afraid of putting down an incorrect answer that goes in the completely wrong direction, as opposed to having nothing down for a solution. I might have to work on this, maybe writing down all possible approaches I can think of, then walk through each one on paper instead of in my head?\n\n- Not writing everything out. During the tests I usually draw things out in a before/after manner, like \u201cI have linked list A like this, and I want it to look like linked list B.\u201d Although I feel this approach is good, I might have to start breaking things down into smaller steps between A and B on paper too, instead of just having the starting and ending steps laid out.\n\n- Problem weighting. The skeleton coding questions that I keep blanking on are often the problems worth the most points on the exam, which only frustrates me even more. If I blank on such a question, I find myself going to other problems I did solve and proofreading them to make sure I can get the most points possible on them instead of spending more time staring at the page of my blank solution space. Although I usually do the exam from front to back, an article recommended looking at all the problems before starting to work on any of them just so your brain can subconsciously work on them for you. This seems like a good idea, but I\u2019m not sure how accurate it is. Instead I end up staring at a problem for a good 15 minutes before accepting defeat and moving on. It\u2019s only after I turn in the problem, or a few minutes after the exam that the solution hits me. A TA recommended only trying to work on a problem if I can think of a good approach within 15-30 seconds of reading the problem, but I doubt that helps me if the problems I have left are only the ones that I can\u2019t think of an approach for.\n\nAny other ideas on what I can try to improve for the upcoming exam? Anyone experience something similar? I\u2019m really sick of the same trend happening in every exam, but I want to make a change since I refuse to just accept this \u201cbad luck\u201d to continue hindering me. Any help is appreciated, thank you for reading and have a blessed day!\n\nTLDR; No matter how much I study, I seem to blank on CS exams. Looking for advice on how I can fix this problem.",

        "post": "I (17) am studying for engineering college exams. I have ended up at a point where i don't know what to do?    \n\n\na bit of backstory: I used to be passionate about science in 9th grade, with aspirations of pursuing research. But, with the pandemic came access to my first smartphone and my aimless days of browsing led to a 7-hour daily screen time. I struggled to keep up with online classes and fell behind in 10th and 11th grade. I indulged in procrastination, which led to poor performance, and in 11th grade, I also cheated on exams, missing important classes and assignments. I asked for help but it didn't turn out well, so I didn't bother asking for more help. My fear of seeking help led to further procrastination and cheating on exams.\n\nIn 12th grade, I tried to catch up and make things right, but my half-hearted efforts, constant worry about my past mistakes, and the pressure of college entrance exams led to poor performance. I only realized the severity of my actions when my college entrance exams were just a month away. I made some good friends and studied a bit, but it still wasn't enough. I came to realize that my actions had consequences, and I was falling behind my peers.  \n\n\nnow, with the academic year set to end in March, I want to assure you that I'm not looking for an easy way out or excuses, I take full responsibility for my actions. I'm determined to turn things around, I'm willing to put in the hard work and effort to make a change. I'm seeking advice and support to help me move forward and make the most out of my remaining time in high school as well as advice for my path forward in aspiring to be an engineer.",

        "post": "I messed up big time. I graduated college this past May with an engineering degree (MatSci). I haven't had work experience since the start of the pandemic (back in March 2020). Since graduation, I have been doing basically nothing and procrastinating. I've probably sent enough applications to count on one hand. I feel like I've screwed up my whole life and wasted all that I've worked for. I've been really struggling with anxiety/depression and it's been through the roof, but I've been getting help with it. I don't know what to do and have no words really. \n\nI'm scared if a potential employer were to ask me what I've been up to since graduation (basically nothing). How should I approach it if it is brought up? What should I be doing and how do I stop the bleeding? \n\nWhat should I start doing asap? Any advice/suggestions or stories?",

        "post": "Currently a second year mech eng student, but I've been a chronic procrastinator since I was in middle school, and it's never affected my grades because I was required to attend class and I just focused there. \n\nThen i started uni, during the covid year. Most semesters I would skip all lectures and tutorials and come back to do my assignments when they were due. Then I'd just cram a bunch of things the night before the final exam and make a pass. Sometimes the material was really boring and the lectures were impossible to stay engaged with, and since we don't have mandatory attendance I got away with minimal effort. \n\nI managed to pass all my subjects up till now, so I didn't learn to stop doing this. This semester might finally be it though, I failed an exam yesterday and have another tomorrow that I haven't started studying for yet. For some reason I can't drag myself off reddit and YouTube enough to even attempt one question, my brain just won't allow me even to try. I feel like I want to fail to teach myself a lesson. \n\nI think I'm guaranteed a fail in two out of four subjects this semester. I need advice. How do I break such an ingrained and intense procrastination habit? I'm really tired of just barely scraping by, I'm here to learn, not to exam technique my way through. It sounds really realy silly, but I think I need help on tricking myself to get the ball rolling.\n\nEdit: I'm new to reddit so gotta go through the mods, sorry for any delays in replying. \n\nI know it's too late to save the grade, I'd like to learn how to be better prepared next time.",

I spent three years at community college doing spring, summer 1, summer 2, and fall. I was also working about 20 hours a week as a draftsman to help pay for college. Then I graduate at the start of Covid and dealt with all that bullshit. I applied to my state school and got rejected because of two D\u2019s that were not my fault (long story, professor was fired) and retook anyway. The dean told me \u201cif I want to  pursue engineering go to a different school\u201d.

        "title": "What Do You Guys Do About Loss of Motivation Since Covid?",
        "post": "I'm currently on my third year of Electromechanical Engineering. Freshman year I was a machine and I was getting all my stuff done without really thinking about it. The end of my Freshman year is when covid happened and I limped to the end academically. Online school is really hard for me, I struggle to stay focused and not just tab out and watch YouTube videos instead. Sophomore year I did decent, not as well as Freshman year, but I got through it though I did fail 4 units (1 class) out of the 34 I took from Fall through Summer (semester system). I do pretty much attribute that failed class to the mental health issues I was having at the time, which are since 95% resolved.\n\nNow that I'm nearing the end of first semester Junior year it feels like it's the hardest it's been so far. My school is still mostly online, though I do live on campus now. I wake up every day and I feel crushed by the amount of things I have to do and I usually find myself procrastinating all day until like 9 pm, which is when I finally get motivation to get some work done, and then I end up going to bed around 2 am.\n\nI have been getting my homework done pretty consistently, I just struggle to find any motivation to study, when Freshman year I would spend at least 10 hours a week studying and not even really think about it. My classes are much harder, don't get me wrong, but I feel like I should still be able to put that time in without feeling utterly exhausted by Tuesday every week.\n\nI don't think I just got lazy out of nowhere, and honestly everyone else is handling it so I should be able to. Can you guys relate to this at all? How can I overcome how hard everything is and feel somewhat fresh again?\n\nP.S. It's worth noting I was doing an internship 30 hours a week for the last six months which I just quit last week to focus on studying. That was really tiring so maybe I'm just not feeling as rejuvenated as I expected to upon quitting.",

        "title": "7 Years Of Engineering - 7 Things I Wish I Had Known",
        "post": "Yea I took 7 years to graduate due not knowing what I wanted to study, horrible course availability and mandatory co-op.\n\nHowever, I don't regret any of it. I wish I have done many things differently and maybe I will when I pursue an online Masters. Here's some realizations that I wished I did in my degree.\n\n# 1. FIND (GOOD) ENGINEERING CLASSMATES TO STUDY WITH!!!\n\nThis is by far the most important. Doesn't matter if you don't do anything else, just do this. I wished I made friends with the smarter or more diligent classmates. Buuuttt... I didn't. I stuck with people I was comfortable with and although they were fun, they weren't really a good influence. EVEN if you think they're smarter or out-of-your league, befriend them and study with them. You might not be best buds but that's okay. Most of the time, you'll be talking about class material or job-related stuff anyways. You'll naturally improve and get better at studying, managing time and receiving or giving help.\n\n# 2. Go to office hours.\n\nWow. I didn't realize how helpful it is. Just spend 5 mins before going to office hours to think of some questions. Of course, don't ask stupid questions but you can just ask Profs or TAs to clarify on concepts or such. They rather you go and ask them then not go because they allotted this time anyways. Also, it's pretty fun just chilling with Profs or TA. Sometimes we don't realize it but they're people too. Chat with them or just talk to them. Most profs are pretty nice and want you to succeed. (Although some hate teaching or you or their own life... Don't waste your time to go to those ones)\n\n# 3. Look for co-ops\n\nMan having a co-op is like a breath of fresh air. You're working, making money and you don't have to go to school :D Win-Win! Also, regardless of what people say, look for companies or positions that **YOU WANT TO WORK**. Sometimes, you might have to pick that crappy position to get to the next level. Fine. But for me, I find that I put a lot more effort in doing projects or building my resume for jobs/positions I care about. I become so much more motivated and interested in building personal projects or job applications because I want it. I want to work there or to work on those technologies.\n\n# 4. C's get Degrees but finding jobs will bring you to your knees\n\nYou can find perfectly good engineering jobs even with a low GPA. HOWEVER, it is so much easier when you don't get filtered out by ATS for having a low GPA. Getting co-ops are so much easier. Getting into Masters programs are so much easier. Basically, having a GPA > 3.0 makes life so much easier in almost every aspect. Also, I find that the courses that I really try and get higher grades tend to be the ones I retain the most information. You enjoy courses more when you're succeeding in it.\n\nI have a 2.67 GPA. Not the lowest but not good. Makes job-searching, co-op seeking such a pain. Can't even do masters :(\n\n# 5. Find a Study Spot (Not Covid Applicable)\n\nIf you have an engineering group to study, just follow them wherever. However if you don't or sometimes want to study alone, find a favourite spot somewhere. Usually I like to grab a coffee, find a quiet spot in the library or study room. I hate open areas because it becomes distracting so somewhere with dividers is pretty nice. Even if you procrastinate or don't feel like studying, it's good enough to just be there. Naturally, over time as you make this a habit, you'll naturally start associating this spot or time as your study sessions. You'll start using this time properly as you develop the habit. So don't kick yourself in the beginning when you aren't studying. Just continue the habit.\n\n# 6. It's Not The End of The World. Take a break\n\nIt's hard when you're so stressed out or burnt out. You get so caught up in this mindset when really your engineering degree is just the start of your **LOOONG** career. You bomb your quiz. You'll be fine. Bomb all your quizzes :| okay maybe you should reconsider your study habits. However, what's most helpful for me is to take breaks. Set a couple hours to go exercises, hangout with friends, watch a movie or play your favourite game. You can do this after a long assignment or study sessions. Understand production and production capability. You might be able to grind a couple more hours to study but you're at 50% capability. It's better that you take 1~2 hours to chill and recuperate to 80% or 90% to work with less stress and more focus.\n\n# 7. Take a Longer Break from School\n\nI wish I took a year off school just to work or to do something else. I saw some people who just took a year or 1 or 2 semesters off, come back refreshed and motivated. Just having the time to think and reflect helps you see what are your values and what goals you want to set in the future. You'll gain a long-term perspective for your degree and for your life. Instead of just trying to grind it out semester by semester, you start seeing the longer term picture.\n\n(I lied. There's 8 tips ;P)\n\n# 8. Enjoy It\n\nYou become a masochist. Although it was the most gruelling, excruciatingly tough and stressful period of my life, it was one of the most worthwhile. I got a lot smarter in every aspect, made a lot of great buddies, did an awesome Capstone that I'm proud of and developed the discipline and perseverance to carry my learning or career for the rest of my life.\n\nAlso, you develop such a strong camaraderie with your fellow classmates. Like all of you have went through hell and back and you look at fondness of your degree while griping on it for such horrible experience. You feel like soldiers returning from a battle and the close brotherhood/sisterhood that you experience is incomparable to anything else.\n\nYou love it and you hate it.\n\n# Reflections\n\nIn the end, beyond just the financial incentives, your degree prepares you to do cool stuff. There's so much advances in technology right now and engineers are in the forefront. An engineering degree is just preparation to get you the opportunities or skillset to do cool stuff for your livelihood. Better to do something fun than something boring for the rest of your life :| (obvious I know but yea... it's something I didn't realize until the end of the degree)",

I was scared and worried about my situation for a long time, but I really want to brave and ask for advice about it.\n\nI am currently in my 4th year in uni and I am studying renewable energy engineering. My journey in the last 4 years have been a disaster. Covid hit in my first year and I couldn't understand anything from online classes. I was doing fine though until I finished my second year. My gpa was good and I was on time with my study plan.\n\nHowever when I started 3rd year everything went downhill. My family started going through financial issues which caused a lot of problems at home. A lot of arguments and fights happened which caused a lot of stress and pressure in my life on top of my courses. I went into depression and wasn't able to focus or care on anything at all. I started procrastinating a lot and barely studied anything. This really affected me in 3rd year. I had failed 4 courses and dropped 2 which really put me behind and lowered my gpa a lot. I considered of quitting and dropping out as I felt hopeless and thought I have no more future.\n\nAll these problems continued in this year as well. I have wrecked myself and my transcript. Till now I have a total of 7 Fs and some Ws on my transcript and my cgpa is 2.7. I am also behind by 1 year now and I need 5 years in total to graduate.  My transcript looks absolutely horrible and I am very scared and worried that it will ruin any chance of getting a good job or a good career. Despite engineering being hard and rigorous I still enjoy and I want to help the environment around me. But I feel like I already ruined my chances to be a good engineer.\n\nI cant switch my major or change uni as its too late, I just want to finish uni at this point and graduate because I am exhausted. I didn't do much on the side either I only have 1 internship I got through a friend but I didn't learn much and it wasn't close to my field.\n\nI am anxious that my uni years will haunt and affect my career for the rest of my life. My question is will it really harm me?\n\nPlease if anyone went through something similar and did horriblly in uni like me (bad gpa, bad transcript, no experience) were you able to find good jobs? Was it a difficult process? Please if anyone can help or advise I would really appreciate it. Thank you",

I feel stuck and demotivated at the moment.\n\nI have achieved the things that I always wanted up to this point.  Last year, I did a placement year abroad and learned a language during it. Earlier this year, I accepted a relevant, engineering graduate job offer, and I am set to graduate with a first-class degree from uni. I should be ecstatic and over the moon to have finally arrived here, 5 years after starting uni, and after years of studying in school before that. These achievements mean even more to me because I had to overcome some significant challenges to get here. All my years of commitment and work have now paid off.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t feel as excited about it as I should be. My final uni semester will finish this coming June, and I have only a couple submissions/exams left now. I am not feeling the pressure like in previous semesters, because even if I barely pass everything, I will still get a first-class degree.

After all this work and achieving these major milestones, I am still sitting here, having to work on uni submissions. My day-to-day life hasn\u2019t changed yet, and right now, I don't want to wait for it to change. I wish I could just travel half a year into the future, when I\u2019d be getting on at my job, getting paid, and having my after-work hours, weekends, and holidays all to myself. Instead, I must complete these remaining pieces of arbitrary uni work, which I am not feeling invested in, and neither are the professors. On-demand, pre-recorded Zoom videos from last year were provided over Panopto, and the tutorial content provided was severely out of date at times. Weekly meetings for my major project are over Zoom, and the guidance I receive in them is often vague and unhelpful. I mostly ignored these and got on with everything regardless, but it has brought down my motivation. In previous years before covid, the university experience felt much more interactive, and I didn\u2019t have to be watching lectures & taking notes from my room. I\u2019ve been to lecture halls two days this year, that\u2019s it.\n\nI have been procrastinating a lot in the past weeks, but I made sure to stay on track with lecture content and I completed essential parts for my larger submission so that I won\u2019t fall behind too badly. But I haven\u2019t worked ahead or put in extra effort to make my work as good as it could be, like I did in previous years. I used to feel proud of the work I did, as I felt that doing my best would help me learn the most that I can. Now, my work just feels like something annoying to get over as fast as possible. This has helped me in getting over my perfectionism, because this year, I submitted work when it was 'good enough' and still got good results in the end. But the work just feels arbitrary and meaningless now.\n\nI know with my rational brain that I just need to get myself together for the next few weeks and crank out the remaining work. I know that I will be in huge stress in a few weeks if I keep severely putting off the remaining work. Even so, I mostly just distract myself and let the time go by instead. I used to procrastinate in the past too, but past a certain point, I got myself together and did the work in the end. But now that I'm so close to the finish line, it all just seems so unreal.\n\nI\u2019m not focusing on the present. Instead, I am constantly looking forward to the summer and to starting work later this year. I need the change in lifestyle, specifically the work-life balance that the 40-hour work week will give me. I feel that at uni, I didn't balance studying and free time as well as I could have. When I wasn\u2019t studying, I was distracting myself by procrastination, or \u2018relaxing\u2019 but feeling guilty whilst doing so, because I wasn\u2019t studying. I didn\u2019t do this all the time, as I still found the time and energy to have enough sleep and keep social to the level that I wanted to, but looking back, I feel that I could have gotten much more out of the experience overall.\n\nI know that by starting to work, my life will not be solved. My problems and bad habits will follow me and materialise again, perhaps in different forms, but they\u2019ll still be there. They say, \u201cwherever you go, there you are\u201d. So I'll need to work on those things regardless of what I do and where I am. I could start now and make my life as optimal as I want to, but I just feel like I want to get past these next few weeks, this chunk of my life, first.\n\nIf you've read this far, thank you very much. Let me know any thoughts you have, however relevant. \n\n**TL;DR: I have what I wanted and I am grateful, but currently, I don't feel much happier. I know I need to get stuff done but I don't feel like it cuz I'm burned out.**",

An hour after that I'll 'get serious' except now I'm disgruntled, need to pace around the room, and soon enough I'm acting like I'm role-playing some cultist from an H.P. Lovecraft novel.

For some reason when the due date is imminent I'm able to focus.

        "post": "Hi guys,\n\nThought I'd type my story here since maybe some of y'all could relate to my situation and slide some advice that could steer me in the right direction. I am currently studying biomedical engineering in Australia and there is so many things that are constantly stressing me out. Wasnt too sure on what flair to pick either, this falls under rant/vent, career help and advice, and academic help, crazy dilemma\n\nOkay so this is what is making me pull my hair out daily\n\n\\- Internships (I have 0 idea how these work, when do I get one and am I even smart enough do work my way through one)\n\n\\- I'm really not enjoying the content we do in class, never been a fan of maths or coding, and i dread them since i struggle with them sometimes, but i can push through it i think, biology was okay in school hence I picked biomedical engineering since I was told for years that once you complete your degree you get a high paying job blah blah\n\n\\- Really really bad procrastination and a lack of motivation, i'm three weeks behind in two out of my four subjects, luckily i am on mid semester break so i will try my best, but the thought of the maths and coding content being difficult is what is scaring me, I often break down when i'm doing these two subjects because i keep thinking im not even going to pass the test and that Ive got so much more content to cover.\n\n\\- Am I actually gonna get a decent paying job after i graduate? this has been stressing me the most, there's thousands of people studying engineering and graduating each year, is there enough positions that i'll get a job with my - so far - mediocre grades\n\nAll four of these things are seriously affecting my mental health badly and I'm really losing my mind because I'm not ready for the day my parents and those who know me see whats going on and what might happen in the future if i keep struggling like this. I'm not even gonna lie tears filled my eyes while typing this up.\n\nThank you so much guys",

I dropped to half time for my 2nd year and joined my university formula student team (FSAE-A).\n\nInterest in my subject picked up as it was more applicable to what i was doing. Your clubs always want more good and hardworking workforce. Not only this, i picked up Data analytics study through Google, NVIDIA deep learning training certificates, knowledge of Ansys Fluent better than people at my Uni and my SOLIDWORKS CSWA (going for CSWP soon).\n\nI went to a networking event (because of the free booze lol). I mostly stood back but also talked to some people from the mining companies, i told them i was interested but not really at the moment as i was busy with what i was doing. I didn't want to work for a big company and be another cog at the moment, as i enjoyed the research projects was doing. The recruits for lack of better words, froth over that. I have some of the recruiters view my Linkedin profile probably 3 times and there were atleast 5 of them.\n\nDon't become another basic engineer that your university just throws out with a degree. Research, Apply, Learn from what went wrong, and what went well, that's how they did it in the old days. Drop a few units, join a few clubs so you can get to the \"Apply\" stage.\n\nI'm not the only one, my friend did the same thing and joined the civil engineering club (who is now the president of the club). Now the job offers are coming to him. People within my FSAEA team also get a lot of job offers, i know many of them have pretty average grades as well but they stand out. They know a lot more than most of their peers, even in later years of their degree.\n\nAnyway, that's enough procrastination, back to work :)",

So that has been really hard to\ndigest because I was looking forward to graduating. That\u2019s okay though because it gives me a little more time to complete my degree. I am working on just accepting this because I have alot to do this semester. \n\nFor the past couple years I have been dealing with depression and ADHD. I am glad I have a lot of help from my school mental health center and the disability center. I see my psychiatrist every month and started my anti depressants again. I also see a coach at the disability center ever week. \n\n\nLast semester I was suspended from my department and was not allowed to enroll in classes anymore. I failed many courses but I got relief from the mental health center which basically wiped off my bad grades. I am super thankful for this, however I was still suspended. \n\nI appealed my suspension after the relief was approved, however my department\u2019s policy for suspension appeals is that you must get a 3.0 gpa in that semester or you will get kicked out with no possibility of getting back in. I am enrolled in 15 credits right now.\n\nThis all feels like a nightmare to me and it doesn\u2019t feel real. For all this time I think my depression has not allowed all of this to hit me and truly change my study habits and knock out of this funk. I am terrified every day that I will fuck this chance up and won\u2019t graduate and waste all my parents money. This thought comes into my head like a rush of panic and I just live in a lot of stress. \n\nI have kept up decently these first 3 weeks but I am so afraid I will begin to fuck up. I really can\u2019t mess this up. I don\u2019t want to lose motivation or burnout or procrastinate or fall in the bad cycle that I do every semester. I live in fear every day and it\u2019s really hard to stay calm and keep pushing myself.  \n\nIf anyone has advice, please help me. This is the time where I need to start getting on top of all my assignments and going to office hours but I need some way to relieve this anxiety and stress too. I feel nauseas and can\u2019t sleep well and my hands have a tremor bc of my anxiety but it\u2019s been alot worse these past few weeks. Like my hands literally just vibrate on their own when I hold them up. I don\u2019t want to burn my body out with carrying all this stress and don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI know I should probably go to the gym or exercise to relieve myself but I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t make enough time to do my work and then I\u2019ll get behind. There has not been a single semester where I didn\u2019t get behind atleast 2 weeks of material (but many more for the past few semesters). I feel trapped in my own little hell and am scared of what will happen if I can\u2019t escape. Please give me advice if you have any, thank you. \n\n\nAlso I have an appointment with my therapist next week however the schools mental health center is very busy and they only have time to see me once a month.

It adds so much unnecessary stress to your life that you don't need. For me, this is how it works: I procrastinate and end up staying up till 6 AM or all night to get the work done, and the next day I'm a zombie. I'm so tired I can't function in the slightest. This leads to not being able to pay attention in class, so I fall even more behind. I also become depressed just due to lack of sleep and stress, so I start stress-eating all kinds of crap food. I'm a pretty fit person, and young enough where I don't see any physical changes yet from all the junk food, but it makes me even more depressed and just feel generally bad. Sometimes I'm so tired I don't even want to go out on the weekends, which makes me even more depressed that I missed that party or the football game, etc. I don't want to talk to anyone really and then get lonely because I isolate myself. \n\nThen, there are periods where I just do my work. I go to sleep on time, feel great the next day, have the energy to go to the gym/play soccer, and make a healthy meal. I feel better from the good food and am generally more happy and social. I actually enjoy my time when I'm not procrastinating, instead of just wasting as much as possible to put off that homework or project. As a result, I'm more productive in non-academic areas, and I'll go talk to that girl, or build something, make some music or art, all because I didn't procrastinate. I'm a senior, so I just want to share some of this (already common) knowledge that I've learned in the hopes that it'll give even just one person the kick they need to JUST START THAT FUCKING WORK NOW.

However, this school year absolutely destroyed my self worth.\n\nI have pretty bad ADHD, and I haven't received help for it because my social anxiety is so crippling that I can't phone the doctor.  I was submitting assignments at the last minute, and staying up for several days in a row to compensate for my procrastination. This had eventually caught up with me. It took such a mental toll on me that I became severely depressed and stayed in bed for a week straight. At this point I missed so much class that I failed all but one of my courses. I finished this whole year with only one credit.\n\nMy question for you guys is: What do I do at this point. I've been avoiding classes for so long that I have forgot all the skills from last year. I just feel so lost. Everyone I talk to about this says I just need to change my major, they try to blame all this burn out is from being in a hard major. But the truth is that I love this major and I find it extremely rewarding. I truly believe that even if I was in the easiest possible major I'd still be struggling just as badly with these same issues.\n\nIs there even a point on trying again next semester? I really think I have messed up my academic plans beyond repair.",

        "post": "So I just want to start of by saying I'm in my second year of college and I'm taking some freshman classes because I switched from IT to Software Engineering. So I have to do some catch up. I'm currently taking 18 credits Cal 1, Physics 1, Programing class and Digital Fundamentals. In high school the only difficult class I had was my honors math classes and they barely any work, so I did not have to do a lot of work and had 3.9 GPA when I graduated. \n\nFreshman year of College I would always hear the professor say ever hour in class is equal to 2 hours at home and that was not the case for my last year. But this year I'm taking 18 credit and right now it's hitting me like a truck. \n\nI have never had a grade lower than B minus in my life but now I have a D minus in my physics class. I don't know if I will be able to get it up to a C and it's making really stressed which is making me depressed and that is making my grades in other classes lower as well. \n\nMy biggest problem is that I used to do my homework last minute because it was so easy but now I can't do that and it has been difficult because it has turned to a habit of always leaving my homework to the last minute and because I have so much I can't finish and hurts my grades. \n\nI found this sub Reddit and the more I read the more I felt more stupid compared to all of the people here. You guys have internships, CO OPs, work and good grades.\n\nIf some of you that have/had had Ds or lower, how did you deal with it?\n\nAlso I really really want to do Software Engineering. \n\nSorry for the long post any type of help would be appreciated.\n\nUpdate: Thank you every one I did not expect this to get this big. I would love to reply to all of you but I would be procrastinating and that is just ironic. This was very helpful!",

Through failed classes, and the many struggles we all face outside of class I kept my head up and did my best. \n\nI cant thug it out anymore, I hate this degree, I hate waking up early to attend my 9am physics, I hate having to do bullshit lab write ups that I have no interest in doing. I hate staying up late trying to understand how to tackle an integral problem. I dread opening canvas and looking at a new week worth of mental anguish. I hate having no free time. I hate spending hours and hours over days studying only to do poorly on a test. I hate how EE killed my love for science. I hate how competitive and insufferable some of my classmates and professors have been. I can't even see myself finishing my associates in science, which I have 75% completed. I've had to retake 5 classes (English THREE TIMES) which added 3 more quarters for me to finish the associates.\n\nI did well at the beginning, my first year i finished with 3.7 GPA and its just been downhill from there. My secod year I earned a 2.3 gpa. In this fall quarter the last 3 test scores I earned were a 63% in calc, 58% in phys, and 67% in calc. I have a phys test on Thursday i know I'm going to do poorly on. I already withdrew from  my CS class,  I stopped showing up to classes, I dont even bother to try on the lab reports or assignments anymore and have turned in a couple half emtpy assignments and incomplete labs this quarter. I doubt I'll find the drive to pass my other 2 classes this quarter.\n\nEveryday is the same. Wake up at 7, eat, go to class, come home, study, work, study, stress about school, and then sleep. I just can't anymore. Weekends are used up trying to get out bed to study more becuase all I've done this quarter is procrastinate.\n\nI think I'm done after this quarter. \n\nI have no clue what I'm going to do or tell my parents that that had so much faith in me to finish the degree. I feel like I'm letting down everyone around me. I let down my parents, my friends, professors I had good relationships with, my younger siblings that look up to me, and myself, I never thought I would give up, I always thought I had that \"drive\" to never give up, becuase I've never given up.

Engineering school is truely the only place on earth your entire ego can be crushed in about a 5 minute period. It's the only place where you can sit down for a end of semster coding interview with your lecturer only for them to explain calmly to you that you don't know anything and that they will be likely failing you. It's the only place on earth where you can have an academic warning for your failing grades, and still be too melancholic to do anything about it. \n\nIf I could take it all back and start from my first year once again I would.

It was\nhorrible to study all night, I felt anxiety because I didn\u2019t know if all of that\n\u201clast-minute-crazy-study\u201d was enough to pass the exam, and I beat myself because\nI never started to study in time.\n\nI failed some exams and barely passed others, I hated myself because I knew I\ncould do better, but I didn\u2019t.\n\nSo I started to read a lot of on how to force myself to do things in time, there\nwere plenty of articles like \u201c10 step to beat procrastination\u201d, \u201c3 steps to get\nto studying\u201d, etc., but I didn\u2019t know how to implement them in a strategic way.\n\nAfter years of experimenting almost everything I created a system that really\nhelped me to get out of that hell.\n\nMy brother was in the same shitty situation, and this system helped him too. It\ngave him a practical guide to implement science-based information in his life\nand so in his daily actions; he already knew some of them, but he didn\u2019t how to\ndo them in a sustainable and consistent way.\n\nNow we pass exams, without a stressful life, enjoying days and knowing that the\nfuture will be a good place to live in.\n\nThanks to the discipline we acquire through this system we now have control on\nour life.\n\n**Practical Guide**\n\nThose are the questions that gave me the possibility to get out of inaction.\n\nThey force me to make a plan which changes the feelings towards what I have to\ndo, and so my actions in the long term.\n\n1.  **WHAT I HAVE TO DO?**\n\n    I start writing down a list of challenges I have to overcome, for example\n    three exams.\n\n2.  **AND IF I DON\u2019T KNOW?**\n\n    I start to look on the university website, looking for my courses exams.\n\n3.  **WICH DEADLINES I HAVE?**\n\n    I use the university site to know when I have exams, and I put the date next\n    to the name of the exam.\n\n4.  **WHAT I HAVE TO STUDY TO PASS THESE EXAMS?**\n\n    I look for materials in:\n\n    1.  Courses links\n\n    2.  Ask in university groups (Facebook, WhatsApp, telegram, etc.)\n\n    3.  Google\n\n    4.  Ask friends\n\n>   It always saves me a lot of time knowing what was the best material to study\n>   on, in the start I wanted to study everything but I had soon known that is\n>   impossible, because I didn\u2019t have the time to study everything.  \n>   So I understood that is really important to put a lot of effort in this\n>   part, because every minute spent here will save me 10x minutes in the\n>   future.\n\n5.**GOOD, KNOW I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO, AND WHAT ARE MY DEADLINES, BUT IT IS\n    POSSIBLE TO DO THIS PLAN?**\n\n>   Now it comes the hard part, at the start I don\u2019t really know how much time\n>   will take to study what I have to study, so I understood that the best I can\n>   do is this:\n\n- **Plan time of the day**\n\n    I plan the hours in the day for every day of the week, at the start it was\n    really difficult for me to study more than 5 hours, seating on a chair for\n    five hours felt like an eternity, but I got used to it, and the time start\n    to pass faster and faster.\n\n    After 1 months I level up at 6 hours, next month 7 hours.\n\n>   *Don\u2019t be afraid if now every minute feel like an hour, thankfully this\n>   perception will change with practice.*\n\n*How many hours you can study really depends on a lot of variables, as subjects,\nsleep, food, parties etc., only you will know the exact time you can and\nshould study, but if you don\u2019t know now just start with 5, then with time you\nwill know it.*\n\n- **Plan study in the day [MACRO]**\n\n    This is the most difficult part because now I don\u2019t really have information to know how much time it will take me to study these subjects, so I have to estimate, and then realign my plan. It can feel scary, but I find it\u2019s the\n    best way to make a plan when you can\u2019t really plan in the first moment.\n\n    **ESTIMATORS**:\n\n- **Lessons (notes, slides etc.)**\n\n    The best option I have is to look at notes (my or other\u2019s notes) and look\n    at:\n\n-   Total lessons\n\n-   Materials in each lesson\n\n-   Duration of lesson\n\n>   Now I can estimate how much it will take me to study a subject:\n\n>   hours to study this subject = number of total lesson \\* duration of the lesson\n\n>   It\u2019s only an estimator, everything varies if I was present in the lesson or if\n>   the subject is simple, but this gives me now the possibility to balance work\n>   in my week; when I will have more information I will realign the plan.\n\n1.  **Book or other sources of material**\n\n    That\u2019s another option, I have to take this option when I can\u2019t find anything\n    else, I write down:\n\n-   Number of pages\n\n>   Then I can divide the total number of pages for the days I have to study.\n\n>   The number spent on pages can vary a lot, and it always takes time to change\n>   the plan. I feel really calm if I\u2019m studying pages rapidly, but I start to\n>   be really nervous if some pages take a long time.\n\n>   In order to protect me from this effect I put a 25% of safety time. So:\n\n>   Pages / day = (total number of pages \\*1.25) / days\n\n>   Safety time always save me from hell, it\u2019s important really to think as this\n>   time does not exist, if I don\u2019t do this I start to study slower. [^1]\n\n[^1]: Parkinson's law: \"work expands so as to fill the time available for its\ncompletion\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law\n\n>   If I can, I use the lesson\u2019s method.\n\n>   *\u00bfWhy this part is so important? It wouldn\u2019t be better to use this time for\n>   studying?*\n\n>   \"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four\n>   sharpening the **axe**.\" - **Abraham Lincoln**\n\n>   Build a plan increase the perception of how much it will be possible reach a\n>   goal [^2], and this influence motivation, so down the line I will not lose\n>   minutes or hours because of lack of motivation.\n\n[^2]: \u201cMotivation is influenced by inherent need to balance expectation of\nsuccess against fear of failure.\u201d\n<http://www.shsu.edu/aao004/documents/11_000.pdf>\n\n>   Second it creates the awareness of what I have to do and know, and this not\n>   only gives a sense of calm, that creates better feelings for studying[^3],\n>   but also creates simpler conditions to say no to other things (for example\n>   parties). When I don\u2019t know what I have to do to get results, it\u2019s easy to\n>   say yes to other things. Then what happens?\n\n[^3]: \u201cAs expected, greater academic stress covaried with lower course grades\u201d\n<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007094931292>\n\n>   I feel anxiety when I\u2019m studying and when I am in my free time because I\n>   don\u2019t have any control on my life. When I finally get to study there is no\n>   time to do everything and so I fail my exams. The day after I beat myself, I\n>   promise that the next time it will be different, but I know that it will be\n>   the same horrible situation.\n\n>   All of this creates a downward spiral of anxiety and stress.\n\n- **Plan study in the day [MICRO]**\n\n>   And if I wake up late? Or if I have some urgent things to do? What will\n>   happen?\n\n>   For example, I wake up at 11, when my plan says I have to start studying at\n>   9, my mind starts to visualize every bad future situation possible, stress\n>   level goes up, I start to see my bed as a peaceful place to so come back to\n>   sleep, how can I stop this?\n\n>   **Rescheduling macro**\n\n>   What I know is that the only thing I can do at the moment is to maximize the\n>   possibility to get a good grade, so I cut thinking and start re-planning\n>   first the macro, I chose what type of combination would be the best and then\n>   I start to program the hours of my day using a blank paper.\n\n>   So if something does not happen as I had planned I have to possibility to\n>   stay calm because I know that I can re-plan and rethink the day, this stops\n>   me from coming back to sleep, minimize the stress, and as a consequence\n>   maximize grades.\n\n>   **Plan the day in micro**\n\n>   I find that I always underestimate the time necessary to do things, now I\n>   know I\u2019m not alone [^4], I found incredibly helpful plan the entire day, if\n>   I don\u2019t have control on every minute of the day I know it will be really\n>   difficult to do what I planned, because my mind every time underestimate\n>   the time necessary to do daily tasks.\n\n[^4]: \u201cDaniel Kahneman who, along with Amos Tversky, proposed the fallacy\n\n    >   The planning fallacy, first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky\n    >   in 1979,[1][2] is a phenomenon in which predictions about how much time\n    >   will be needed to complete a future task display an optimism bias and\n    >   underestimate the time needed.\u201d\n    >   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy>\n\n>   So I schedule sleeping, eating, friends, sport relaxing, time for change\n>   location etc.\n\n>   This could sound crazy but I find that a lot of successful people do this[^5].\n\n[^5]: <https://www.forbes.com/pictures/hhfi45gjf/secret-1-they-focus-on/#25abe4e86a72>\n\n6.**WHERE**?\n\n    If I can, I always chose a place where there are other people that are studying hard and not procrastinating, I find mathematicians, physicians, and other hard scientists the more disciplined. This is important because it is emotionally easier to study when people around you are not fu\\*\\*ing around.\n\n    The best is to find a library, it is easier to avoid distractions there, and\n    it is more difficult to be distracted.\n\n7.**HOW to REACH MY GOALS, ENJOY THE LIFE AND AVOID BECOMING CRAZY?**\n\n>   It takes me a long time to understand what makes a life like this enjoyable\n>   and stressful, it is necessary to create conditions that sustained positive\n>   feelings and energy in the long term.\n\n>   **So what influence energy level and feelings?**\n\n8.**SLEEP**\n\n    I always know that sleep is important, but I couldn\u2019t sleep enough. When I\n    went to bed I started massively binge-watching on YouTube or watching films\n    and series or simply whatever gives me the possibility to get out of reality\n    and gives me the possibility to feel better.\n\n    The worst part?\n\n    When I stop I felt even worse and so I continued doing that until late\n    night.\n\n    So in the morning after was almost impossible to wake up early; when I did\n    it, my head was sleepy and tired, and so it was impossible to study.\n\n    I find that in order to sleep well it is necessary to create conditions to\n    sleep well, it sounds stupid but it\u2019 just a relation of causes and effects.\n\n    So what\u2019s influence sleep?\n\n-**Did I scheduled the time to do what I enjoy or to do nothing?**\n\n    I\u2019m human, I need to feel good, that\u2019s it if I don\u2019t take time to feel good\n    my body will take the time messing my plans.\n\n    So if I acknowledge this situation, I come back to my plan and I reschedule.\n\n    But what if there is no space?\n\n    **That\u2019s an indicator that I want to do too many things**\n\n    It was really difficult to accept and realize that I can\u2019t use the whole\n    time of my week, I tried every possible weird solution, but now I know that\n    if I don\u2019t take time to rest, my feelings will give me hard time to do what\n    I\u2019ve planned.\n\n    The book \u201cEssentialism\u201d gave me an understanding of the importance of doing\n    less, but also on how much is difficult to do less [^6].\n\n    [^6]: <https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawtonursrey/2014/04/17/the-art-of-essentialism/#51edff846516>\n\n-**Am I tired?**\n\n    If I\u2019m tired what can I do about it?\n\n-   **If I wake up late then at night I\u2019ll not be tired, what can I do about\n    it?**\n\n    At the start is really difficult to wake up early, my head easily convinces\n    me that is better to sleep because:\n\n    -   It is too scary to think what I have to do\n\n    -   I can\u2019t study if sleepy and tired\n\n        It really helped me think that the first day is like un investment\n        for the days after, it doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m not super productive today,\n        but it\u2019s really important to be tired this night.\n\n-  **Am I doing some physical activity?**\n\n    How can I do some physical activity if I hate the gym, running or whatever is a\n    sport?\n\n    The best solution I find is from nerdsfitness.com [^7]: jog for three\n    minutes, and then push sprint hard for a minute, repeating this cycle for a\n    certain amount of time (usually around 20 total minutes), it takes a little\n    time and I don\u2019t need any subscription to the gym or to buy anything.\n\n    [^7]: <https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/kick-your-ass-and-kickstart-your-metabolism-in-20-minutes_v_coaching/>\n\n    It also gives me all benefits of cardio, makes me tired in the night and make\n    me feel good thanks to endorphins that my body release.\n\n9.**FOOD**\n\n    I always knew that food is important and that I have to eat vegetables and\n    fruits and blablabla, but how can I start to use food as a fuel?\n\n    Without a comprehension on how food work in my body it was always difficult,\n    the book \u201cBigger, leaner, stronger [^8] gives me an understanding of how\n    food impact on my level of energy, then I use that book to create a \u201cdiet\u201d\n    of food I enjoy to eat, that doesn\u2019t cost a lot and that doesn\u2019t take too\n    much time to be prepared.\n\n    [^8]: <https://www.amazon.it/Bigger-Leaner-Stronger-Building-Ultimate-ebook/dp/B006XF5BTG>\n\n    The results are astonishing, I\u2019ve never been so full of energy in my life,\n    and it feels really good.\n\n    What I understood is that I can\u2019t put myself to do hard work with a low\n    level energy, because in the long time I will start to take action in the\n    wrong direction.\n\n    That\u2019s it, I accept it, I stop beating myself, instead, I start to exploit\n    how my body works.\n\n10.**FRIENDS, ALCOOL, AND PARTIES**\n\n>   I wanted to know: can I become successful in university and at the same time\n>   enjoy my twenties?\n\n>   The answer was yes, not simple but possible, how?\n\n-  **Schedule time for parties and for rest in the morning**\n\n    I always read about the importance to wake up at the same hour and go to bed\n    early and blablabla, but how can I go to a party, drink and then wake up not\n    too late?\n\n-  I eat a lot before going out\n\n-  I arrive at the party late\n\n    *If I arrive late the time I will pass drinking will be shorter, this is\n    really helpful if the day after I have to study*\n\n-  I drink beer or wine, it easier to drink less, but if I prefer to drink\n    a strong drink I chose a ratio 1 alcohol to 3 non-alcohol\n\n-  I do something, a game or find a girl you like, or I talk with the person on a\n    a subject I enjoy or I dance. Having something to do takes my attention away\n    from drinking\n\n-  If I can, I come back to home walking\n\n-  I drink a lot of water when you come back home\n\n-  I eat when you come back home and take a little bit before going to bed\n\n-  In the morning I take it easy, I take a hot shower, thanks to my schedule\n    I know I can rest and not doing anything without concerns\n\n- It\u2019s really important to eat to level up my energy\n\n- If it\u2019s not late (12.00), I study two hours, eat \u201clunch hour 15\u201d and then\n    powernap for 30/40 minutes, then study for others three to five hours (17-20\n    or 17-22)\n\n- If it's late (15:00), I eat lunch, rest for half an hour and then study for\n    3 to 4 hours\n\n*\\*\\*if you can, wake up at the same time and don\u2019t drink, you will have much\nmore time of fresh mind during the week*\n\n11.**Deal with friends**\n\n>   I used to have friends that wanted to go out every night, and partying all\n>   the time, I understood that I couldn\u2019t. Making plans to reach my goal, give\n>   me the possibility to realize how much energy and time I have to put in\n>   school, so I started to say no to them.\n\n>   It\u2019s not easy because they prefer to have all of their friends at parties,\n>   and they put a lot of effort to change your ideas, there was I time where I\n>   couldn\u2019t say no, I change this working and thinking about what I want to do in\n>   life; this was the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life, but it\n>   saved me from self-destruction.\n\n>   A book that really helped me was \u201cThe 7th habit of Highly Effective\n>   People\u201d[^9], it gave me the possibility to see what it would have happened if\n>   I didn\u2019t\u2019 change something in my life, this created a need for understanding\n>   and learning that changed my thinking, my actions, my results and my\n>   feelings towards life.\n\n[^9]: <https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit7.php>\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to change our daily actions and get out inaction and\nprocrastination, but I promise that it will be worth it.\n\nI already walked in the hell you\u2019re in now, and I wish I had someone who could\nhelp me get out of there.\n\nIn the next articles:\n\n\u2022 **Food plan for astonishing energy levels!

I scored a 7/100 in the midterms\u2014yes, the professor is one of the worst in the whole uni. I was devastated and frustrated, almost ready to give up on this degree because I\u2019m exhausted with EE. \n\nExperiencing a complete burnout, I stopped studying, convinced I would fail and prolong my degree, wasting more money.  Unfortunately, it was too late to drop the class, so my only option was to try to pass. \n\nA classmate suggested studying the weekend before the exams. I had never attended a study session before because I always believed I should know something beforehand and ended up procrastinating until the very last minute\u2014a terrible idea for an EE student.  \n\nHowever, I attended the first day without any preparation. Witnessing my friend solve those problems helped me immensely; suddenly, everything clicked. To my surprise, I aced the final and passed this BS class.  \n\nMoral of the story: even if you\u2019re unprepared, attending these study sessions can make a huge difference!!!!!\n\nHappy Holidays!! Get some rest next semester we killing it!!!!",

Would appreciate advice on how to fall in love with the subject again. \n\nI\u2019m a second year CS student, and I feel somewhat empty that something that used to be my passion isn\u2019t making me happy like it used to. This is a long post, but please take the time to read it if you can. I would really appreciate advice because I want to love CS again.\n\nI feel guilty complaining about this, but I\u2019m low key losing my shit from burnout. I feel like I have nothing to complain about because I\u2019m an A student who doesn\u2019t work that hard, but it\u2019s so stressful, even when a lot of my peers are getting low grades and some are failing. I went to an INSANE public high school with STEM majors (and of course I did CS lol).\n\nI worked myself to death and also had really severe health issues for a while. Now I\u2019m finishing my second year at a highly ranked University at the top of my class, but simultaneously feel lazy and undeserving of my accomplishments. I can never find the motivation to work on homework, projects, and labs anymore, until close to the due date because I know I can get them done faster than everybody else.\n\nThen I have to work insanely fast and am ridiculously stressed out trying to get my stuff done, but it\u2019s always in on time, just barely. It\u2019s not procrastination. It\u2019s dreading something I used to love. Maybe it\u2019s the pressure to maintain the status quo of being a top student. I feel low key like Luisa from Encanto. Idk if the pressure just flattened me over time or if it was something else.\n\nThe longer this has gone on, it\u2019s messed up my personal life too. I\u2019m ALWAYS tired and refuse to hang out with cs majors because it stresses me out thinking about class. I love my mostly political science friend group, but it would be nice to have cs friends.\n\nAny tips on how to fall back in love with cs? It\u2019s such a cool subject, but school is kind of ruined for me. Dw I\u2019m not dropping out. I just thought being at the top would bring me happiness over time, but it\u2019s done the opposite and I have no idea what to do next. I would be appreciate any suggestions because CS has been very important to me for a long time.",

        "post": "I want to apply for some hardware engineering jobs in California (electronics or computer hardware engineering jobs mainly FPGA development). I would like to choose a career in this industry after school. I have a lot of issues with procrastination, but it is only when it comes to school, assignments, and exams, other then those I am pretty happy and successful in life. I am a fast learner, and I actually have 127 IQ. I have 5 pages of detailed report from a valid test at hospital at a psychiatric and psychological part, done with a psychologist. I would like to achieve some goals to apply for more competitive hardware engineering internship jobs.\n\nThere are two scenarios.\n\n1. I am working 8 hours per day for this 4 months (paid mechanical engineering internship  ). I can fit 3 hours of studying per day and 18 hours per weekend. I would like to improve my FPGA development knowledge with VHDL, get better in C++, and learn Altium Designer and MATLAB from zero.\n2. I am working 20 hours per week (regular minimum wage job). I can fit 10 hours of studying per day and nothing for the weekend so 50 hours of studying per week. Again to improve my FPGA development knowledge with VHDL, get better in C++, and learn Altium Designer and MATLAB from zero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow much could I improve myself for internship jobs with these two different scenarios in 4 months? \n\nI will really appreciate some help. I will need to choose between these two choices I would also really like to receive some recommendation with my choices if you find necessary such as cancelling something, or replacing something in my program with an alternative/better option (such as cancelling C++ and learning another design tools, etc.).",

        "post": "I started freshman year with high hopes and ended up pretty unhappy with myself. Does anyone have tips to improve for sophomore year? Specifically, with study tips/time management for classes and how to foster/maintain friendships? I\u2019ll be taking a higher course load than before (18 credits) and trying to do extracurriculars(clubs,undergrad research), so I\u2019m a little scared that it\u2019ll end up the same way and be miserable.\n\nFull Year Recap\n\n* GPA\n   * Expectations: Get a really high gpa(3.8+) to pad it for later year engineering classes and be competitive for internships\n   * Reality: Got a 3.5 gpa fall semester and 3.3 in the spring (3.4 cumulative). Both semesters I was super scared of losing my scholarship(have to maintain a 3.2). Struggled in calc 1/2 (which were honors classes that didn't have a discussion portion or curve. got a B-/B) and struggled in my chem lab and chemE class(curved to a B). I\u2019m super scared that this downward trend will continue in the future, since I thought I learned from my mistakes in fall semester\n* Major\n   * Expectation: Figure out what if I want to stay ChemE and what area in ChemE I want to specialize in\n   * Reality: Felt more dissatisfied with chemE the more I researched career paths and strongly wanted to switch but decided to wait until I took an actual chemE class in the spring. Took that and definitely would have failed if I didn\u2019t form a study/homework group. At the end of spring semester I switched to bioengineering(something I was always debating ever since I was a HS senior), but have no idea what exactly I want to do.\n* Sleep\n   * Expectation: In bed by midnight and sleep for 8 hours\n   * Reality: Very erratic sleep schedule. Probably in bed by 12 or 1 am for most days, but on test weeks or the week leading up to them I would stay up until 3 doing work and wake up at 6 to continue studying. Whenever assignments are packed up I would always sacrifice my sleep and be at the library 24/7. My roommate was always so concerned since I would return to our room so late lol\n* Procrastination\n   * Expectation: Do work right when its assigned and review what I learn in lectures nightly\n   * Reality: At the beginning of both semesters I would do this, but when assignments with earlier deadlines came up I would scrap my whole schedule and spend time only on that class. I also wouldn\u2019t do any work on some days and spend hours and hours on others. I think I was burnt out from working superhard the day before that I couldn\u2019t make myself do more work later on. The days where I didn\u2019t do anything weren\u2019t even restful since I would spend it on my phone or watching something. \n* Social Life/Friends\n   * Expectation: Make a few friends that I could have fun with on my freetime\n   * Reality: Completely sacrificed making friends for school. I was okay with that when I thought I would get all As, but now that I failed myself with my grades my lack of friends is even more disappointing. I pretty much tagged along with my highschool friends and roomate\u2019s friends, and made \u201cclass friends\u201d but those relationships didn\u2019t really bloom into anything. I realized this way too late and started to invite people to eat at the dining hall or study together at the end of the school year.",

        "post": "Ok, so this might not seem like much, but it was a hell of an achievement for me.\n\nI've been struggling with the usual crap when you enter an engineering degree, feeling completely dumb, useless, misfit, etc. I've always been a depressive person, and for the past 3 years have been struggling with clinical depression, suicidal tendencies (thankfully those are gone now), fucked up medication and estrangement from my colleagues. My life was completely fucked up, I was drugged to the point of barely being functional as a human, let alone a productive student. I've not been able to do any course in the past 12 months, and in the last 24 months I've only managed to do 2 courses.\n\nI don't know how colleges worldwide are, but here if you don't have a good performance for a time (you have 3 years to finish your first year, and have to do an average of x courses per year) you are barred from college for a year, and in the year after that you have to get your shit together or face unenrollment.\n\nSo, as you can imagine, I was pretty much in dire straits, had to do 2 courses this semester to not be kicked out and my parents where pretty much fed up, even though they understand my predicament (tuition isn't free...). Combine that with a life or procrastination, and shit isn't easy.\n\nBut today I don't bring you a sad story, but a happy one. I managed to go from no course done in 12 months to 4 done out of 6 courses (my average when I entered college was 5 out of 6, it's normal here.). I managed to find enough strength in me to come back (slowly...) to enjoy what I'm learning, to don't give up during finals, and now I'm reaping the benefits of it!\n\nI hope someone out there, who is going through the same crap I've gone through, finds this post and believe that if I can do it, then they can too! Perseverance (and a good therapist who nags me every single day to ask what I did that day) and finding enjoyment in what you do is key to go back to track!\n\n\nGood luck all of you!",

        "post": " \n\nI\u2019ve always known I am a loser, since my childhood, I tried to appeal to people and nothing seemed to work. I figured early on that a fat kid isn\u2019t an attractive kid to hang out with, I am not cool, no girl or guy would befriend me. I\u2019ve never accepted this though, I\u2019ve always judged people, and I\u2019ve always known I am better than some, definitely, I am.   \nIt is until highschool that I figured, I am good with Maths and Physics, let me capitalize on this, I explained complex problems to the cool kids to be friends with them. It worked.  \nIn my graduation year, I changed schools, and in one year everyone knew me, I became THE funny and smart kid. Everybody came to me to explain to them stuff. I liked it. For once I am on top of the world.   \nDon\u2019t get me wrong I like giving, I liked it so much, helping some of my colleagues getting through high school and scoring better grades or understanding something that bothered them for so long. I enjoyed it so much.   \nSummer came, everybody graduated, I am useless now.   \nThey go to the beach, no one bothers to invite me. They go out, no one picks the phone to call. I was sitting in my room. Alone. Watching Instagram stories of my friends enjoying their time together. I sucked it all up. We would rarely meet, and when we do, I would treat them as if nothing happened. I loved them, so much, but it hurt so bad. \n\nAnyway, I was happy I got accepted into my dream school, which will soon turn out to be a disaster. I was always aiming to get into what I thought to be the top engineering school in my country. It was tough getting into it. I thought that I would be studying with the smartest students of my country and that the teachers are going to be the best of the best, and that they would come and pour their knowledge onto us. I literally believed that there would be good teachers, who will value us, me at least. I came with the mentality of wanting to learn. After one week I was paranoid, I would fail the first year. I was terrified, all I could see and hear from the older students, is careful of this teacher he is resentful, that other teacher just give up on his subject you will never score well in it, you need to cheat to pass. Hell on the first day of school one of our teachers told us that 50% will fail (which is so not true). I was paranoid, scared shitless. This trauma repeated itself for 5 years.   \n5 years of bad teachers, cheating professors, and useless subjects. I became bitter like hell. I tried being positive, I always cheered up my friends who were feeling down I always denied the negativity, only this year it caught me too. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I wasn\u2019t happy I was just in denial. I soon after getting into engineering school I figured I am not meant to be an engineer, I however pushed myself. I wanted to make my grandma and mom happy.   \nThis year I figured I will never be able to work in a technical field, it is just not for me.   \nSo I decided, if I am going to be sad or not passionate, I should at least earn good money while being sad ( in case you are confused I live in Morocco, big multinational companies come to my country to exploit engineers and workers and pay them low wages since most of the students are poor they pressure them to accept low salaries -400 USD a month in some cases-).  \nI started preparing for the french equivalent of GMAT, to get into business schools and transition to finance, since I kinda like finance and entrepreneurship, and I like the proactivity of it.   \n05 December was my exam day, I didn\u2019t prep very well because in part I procrastinated a lot on it and because I suck at french, and a huge part of the exam was in french. Also, my grandma was being so sick, she lost consciousness, she was dying .. I couldn\u2019t see her on her last daying, partly because of COVID but also because I was trying to prep for the exam in what was left in time. Long story short, on 05/December I went to a different city, did my exam, came back and was planning to see her, I was so sick though and had harsh migraines, I decided to sleep and go the next day, the next day I procrastinated all-day, until mom called and told me to come at my grandma\u2019s she was being so sick. I was terrified, I was her favorite grandson, she was my favorite person in the whole world, she still is, I was doing all this to make her proud, I\u2019ve taken the trauma and the stress for her.   \nMoments after I arrived, I saw people sitting, I sat down next to her, and after a few minutes, a sudden sound was heard, It was the ventilator she was on, she died.   \nI remember before when she was starting to fade, she had no energy to open her eyes or talk, she would be quiet even if my mom and my uncles are there, but when she heard my voice or my name she would fight to open her eyes move her hands and say hi to me, I will never forget it.   \nDecember 5th I went to the cursed exam, on December the 6th she died. I scored horribly.   \nI signed for a new session, I wasn\u2019t giving up. I started studying very hard, I saw myself improve very much, I was taking my mind off my grandma and my depressed nihilistic ideas, I was keeping busy, only for the resentful teachers to show themselves.   \nwe were supposed to start our capstones and have exams at the same times, they decided to drag us with exams and courses until April ( for reference we are supposed to finish every exam by February and start our internships, some friends even heard teachers laugh at us and say mean things about us). I was fed up, my TAGE MAGE( the exam I m taking for business schools) is scheduled to be on the 20th of march, I lost close to a months worth of prep I feel like I lost all the skills I gained, I m back at square one, I will score horribly again.   \nI am going to fail, again. My score won\u2019t get me into a top school, and I can\u2019t have my parents pay so much money for me to be a failure.   \nI wasn\u2019t with my favorite person in the world in her last days just so I would fail.   \nI hate the person I\u2019ve become, I don\u2019t see a point in living anymore, I now can\u2019t even focus for 15 mins, my brain is fucked, I am so dysfunctional and useless.   \nI am a driveless, goalless, and pessimistic 23-year-old engineering student who absolutely hates what he studies.   \nI just want to give up, but I can\u2019t.",

Another fear of mine was that everyone around me was Einstein-level smart and that I was the stupidest one there. But I put my pride aside and started asking questions in class, like literally whenever I didn\u2019t understand something. That helped me A LOT and also after befriending some of my classmates I learned they were in the same boat as me. I got my grades up through study groups and homework sessions with others. I also got known as the girl who asks way too many questions, but a couple random classmates actually thanked me for this as they were confused also but too shy to ask. I started to enjoy the lab work and told myself that everything was doable.\n\nThe workload absolutely sucked sometimes, but the cool thing about humans is how adaptable we are. There\u2019d be weeks of nonstop work and then some weeks of little to no work. Planning out my schedule and sticking with it really helped me. I found plenty of time to still go out and do other activities. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, I am the WORST procrastinator. So what I\u2019m trying to say is if I can do it, so can you!\n\nI did struggle in a couple classes to the point where I was going to office hours but other than that I never failed a class or came close to failing. My end goal was to still get an awesome high paying job right out of college. However, I realized that I didn\u2019t like my engineering internships and felt really stuck. However, that\u2019s the beauty of engineering! I started looking into other industries and found that a majority of companies are always on the lookout of engineers, even some positions I\u2019d never heard of had accepted engineering degrees. So, I looked into the consulting industry and got an offer/interviews with a ton of great companies. I think that being an EGR major made me stick out in a good way.\n\nAll in all, I made the best memories and best friends from majoring in engineering. I know everyone\u2019s situation/experiences are different, but in my opinion is don\u2019t listen to people saying that it\u2019s impossible to major in STEM. I had a great experience full of ups and downs. I will never be happier than when my robot started to work or after finishing a code.\n\nI leave for NYC soon as a person with a mechanical engineering degree \ud83e\udd73  stick with engineering!! It\u2019s such a reward getting a degree like this :)",

        "title": "Not sure if going in the right direction/Need Life Advice",
        "post": "Hello Fellow Engineering Students,\n\nI apologize for the long post in advance.\n\nI was wondering if I could get some advice about school and life in general. I am a 2nd year engineering student going into their 3rd year that recently switched to electrical engineering from a different type of engineering. I seem to have an issue: I am very inconsistent with studying. I study really hard one quarter then the next quarter I mess up and not study that much in the beginning and have to study my butt off to get lower grades than I know I capable of. \n\nFor example, this year my GPA for each quarter was:\nFall: 2.67\nWinter: 3.66\nSpring (Most likely): 3.01\n\nOverall, I have a 2.99 overall GPA but I feel like could and should do better.\nI don't party (or do really anything outside of school and officer position in engineering club on campus), so this inconsistency can only be attributed to procrastination and poor study techniques/cramming. As far as procrastination, I try to write out all the things I need to get done that day on my iPhone in scheduled time segments, but I have a tendency to procrastinate late at night instead of sleeping because I always feel like I am not getting enough done during the day, despite following my daily plan pretty consistently. I think this could probably be solved by thinking more carefully about what I want to get done in a day and being honest with myself with how much I can get done.\n\nAs far as studying goes, this part is a little complicated. I have read multiple Reddit posts, watch countless videos (Thomas Frank, CrashCourse Study Skills, MajorPrep, etc.), and read multiple books (How to be A Straight-A Student, Deep Work, A Mind for Numbers, Guaranteed 4.0) on how best to study, and I think I have the solid fundamentals of studying down. My issue is that I second guess myself a lot and have a tendency to try to see how other people study and not use the techniques that I have read, seen, and done that have worked.\n\nThe study system that I plan to use this summer for circuits I is:\n\n1. Read the Syllabus:\nNote Pace of Course.\nAsk Prof. Best Way to Study for Class.\nSet Grade Goals for each class on a flashcard (Realize I should start setting this as all As instead of As and Bs).\n\n2. Skim sections/chapter of textbook to be covered in class before class (if possible):\nMath/Stats: 1 section at a time.\nPhy/Engineering: Read intro, skim chapter (section headings, diagrams, important eqns), Read summary (if available; if not, look up vids on chapter, or skim [using active recall this time] once more).\n\n3. Go to Class, Sit Near Front, Take Good Notes:\nGet to class early, talk to classmates.\nReview lecture notes from previous class before class.\nNote key parts of notes and add further explanations.\nreview lecture notes while in class; note when confused. \nAsk questions during and after class until you understand the lecture material.\nReview lecture notes the day of the lecture (preferably right after class)(compare to the textbook).\nKeep a list of all assignments and their due dates on a sheet of paper in the front of your binder.\n\n4. Start doing problems (review lecture notes first) (do problems everyday):\n Do HW ASAP if already assigned.\n If no HW yet, do problems similar to the textbook/lecture.\n Do enough probs to cover all the cases in your lecture notes.\n try to do a few probs on the topics of lecture the date they are lectured on (at least 1-3 probs).\n study with others when possible/needed.\n\n5. Go to Office Hours/Tutoring/Email Professor and TAs questions.\n\n6. After done with homework, quiz yourself on HW/lecture notes to see if you could answer them without referring to your notes:\nNote your areas of confusion; do extra/challenge probs based on HW/lecture notes.\n\n7. At end of the week (Friday or Saturday), Review lecture notes for the entire week for each class:\nnote where you are confused; Email prof/ta's questions or text your friends about it.\nMake flashcards.\nRepeat steps 2, 4, and 6.\n\n8. If midterm or final is in 10 days:\nSkim through rest of material that will be on the exam (that we may not have covered yet in class).\nTake a practice exam (either from professor or another university that covers the same material/ask questions in a similar way to my professor)(do w/ only 75% amount of time than you will actually have on the exam)(no need to review your letcure notes/hw too much).\nCorrect the exam, figure out mistakes, review lecture notes/hw/extra problems you (may have) already done; do extra problems as needed.\nTake another practice exam (6-4 days before the real exam) (if time).\nMake a cheat sheet of all the concepts for each exam on the same sheet; Rehearse all concepts aloud.\n\nFor Exams/Quizzes:\nRead thru whole exam and note length of each problem and its point value.\nStart working on a problem with a higher point value (Make sure to see if all parts of problem dependent on each other or if they are independent).\nGet as far as you can on harder/higher point value probs (dont spend too long), then go to easier probs you can solve.\nNever leave any part of a question blank (if possible).\nLeave at least 15-20% of exam time to double check your answers. \n\nTell me what you guys think/what could I do to improve or simplify in my study system (hopeful i'm not overthinking lol).\nAlso, do you know how I can create more free time for myself? I always feel like I am studying more than I need to and therefore always feel guilty when I hang out with friends (which stinks too, but I think I am a pretty sociable person when I am not thinking about school).\n\nAlso, I know this sounds weird, but I feel sad sometimes when I ask girls (who I think are smart and cool) to study and they automatically assume that I am trying to ask them out (which is definitely not my intention). I guess I have to make sure I am already studying with other guys and invite to study with the group so they don't get the wrong idea.\n\nAdditionally, if I want to work on making better batteries and electronics/data storage devices (for sure) or power generation (not sure), should I go to grad school in applied physics, materials science, or not go to grad school and try to learn this stuff on my own. \n\nAlternatively, I have always wanted to start a technology business that provides a solution to a problem hasn't been adequately solved yet or create a niche product that people find useful. Do you think making new products out of recyclable materials (like making new electronics or shoes out of old stuff or making manufacturing processes more automated/efficient to make it cheaper to manufacture in the US) is a good business? I will try to read a lot to find better business ideas.\n\nFinally, I want to keep learning outside of college (i.e. more math/programming). What do you guys think is the best way to do this?\n\nAgain I apologize for such the long post, I just have been holding a lot of these thoughts to myself and my dad and it's nice to be able to express myself to others (need to work on that too).",

        "post": "(Hey didn't realize this post would be so long, but please read through if you can)&nbsp;\n\nHey guys,\n\nI'm going into my second-year as a Computer Engineering major and as you can tell by the title, this isn't question about my homework.\n\n\nMy hesitation with my major started right when I started my freshman year. We were all required to take 17 units (quarter system) and I was not prepared for this. During the weekends when I could go over a simple comp sci concept, I would sulk and procrastinate. I didn't do so well in my classes and ended up with a 2.3 GPA.\n\nThe next quarter I took Physics for the first time, *yes*, for the first time *ever* (my crap ass high school never required it). It's an understatement to say that I struggled. I went to tutoring, too, and still could not grasp what all the engineering students thought were so easy. I ended up barely passing with a C-. \n\nAnd the next quarter, I took Intro CS. At first, I thought I was fine. But every week I realized I was just searching the whole internet for solutions, asking on reddit and stackexchange to do my homework. Heck, I even went to office hours for help and still did a shit show for my homework. My test grades were even worse with C's and D's and I ended with a D in that class. I tell peers that the reason I didn't pass CS was because I was focused on passing Physics 2\u2014which I also barely passed with a C (but to be fair 90% of the class failed all the tests)\u2014 which is a bullshit excuse, I know. I have to retake Intro CS in the fall, which doesn't mess with my graduation date, but keep in mind majority of the class, who aren't only CS/engineering students, got A's and B's. And I'm sure 98% of the engineering students passed, if not aced, Intro CS.\n\nOn the bright side^yay? I did well in my math classes, which is where I got the idea to be a CE major from. In high school, my calculus teacher, whom I looked up to my whole high school career, told me I had the math skills to pursue engineering and encouraged me to apply. ~~My dumbass didn't even know what I was getting myself into.~~ I like math, and its the only class that's helping my shit GPA. But I finished all my required math classes and I'm kinda sad that that's over.\n\nAnother reason why I applied for engineering was also because of the ~~moneymoneymoney~~economic mobility that my family could gain from me. I am a first-gen college student. I come from a single-parent family where my mom earns a fraction of what an engineer makes. And I kid you not, when I told my family I was going to be an engineer, they were so excited and proud they even threw a party for my college admittance. I can't help but feel like I have to do this for them, as their \"last hope.\" ~~It can also be my Asian filial piety that's making me feel like i *have* to do this.~~ \n\n\nI'm taking a Statistics class right now (CE requirement) and I kinda like it and was maybe thinking going into Financial Math and Statistics or Actuarial Science, since I've finished most of the pre-major requirements in my engineering curriculum. But I can't get myself to take the chance and leave engineering forever.\n\n\nThis upcoming quarter I'm taking Physics 3 (electronics and that kinda stuff), Intro Circuit Analysis, and Intro CS. If I don't pass Physics 3 and/or Circuit Analysis I prolong my schooling by one year, due to the classes being offered once a year in sequence. I was thinking that if I don't get A's or B's in the classes I was going to drop my major the quarter after. But just the thought of studying twice as hard as everyone else (only to get shit grades), working on campus, and being active in a fraternity; i doubt I'll have time to do A/B-work.\n\n\nSo reddit, am I giving up? Am I trudging through this curriculum only for superficial reasons? Or should I stay and see if it gets better?\n",

        "post": "I've been contemplating this idea for a while now. \nFor context I'm 24 and in 6th yr doing 3rd courses. And currently on my 5 or 6th academic probation (at this point I've lost count) and also I did a 12 month internship. \n\nImma be honest, I never had good study habits ever since grade 12 highschool. Procrastination, distraction, undisciplined , super lazy and recently low moral. \n\nA part of me wants to drop out and other doesn't. The reason I don't want to is, mainly I'm running away from a problem and haven't finished what I've started. The reason I do want to drop out is, I'm 25 and most of friends are graduated already, seeing them finished and working -makes me feel like that I've never graduate as an engineering and that I'll be 27 , that's right 27 (I'm Indian btw) and in my community everyone's already smart af, even though idgaf what other ppl say it's the things my parents say, some of its just bs but the rest is kinda true. Like which company would hire a 27 yo graduate whos got multiple academic probations on his transcript. Another reason I want to drop out is I might fail/score low my exam thus won't get out of probation - ultimately resulting me getting kicked outta the program. So to save face I want to drop out . But I don't have a backup plan so idk should I drop out or not ?? As of recently I've been super lazy and stopped caring about engineering - like why ? Wtf happened to me ( not sure if a pron addiction adds to my fucked up mental state)",

        "post": " For the last two years, I\u2019ve been going to a community college working on my AA degree while living with my dad and grandmother. My college has an agreement with a large state university that students who get their AA here can be automatically accepted and have their credits transfer seamlessly. My plan was to take this deal and commute to the university for two years while earning my BS in Computer Engineering.\n\nI just got my AA degree at the end of the last spring semester but my housing situation changed unexpectedly when my grandmother passed and we had to sell her house. My dad found a small apartment to live in temporarily until I figured out where I wanted to live for college. \n\nMy first mistake was actually filling out my application for the state college much too late. I think I submitted it in early-mid April. I did not anticipate that the university would take 8 weeks to process my application and accept me. Now that I\u2019ve finally been accepted, I\u2019ve realized this was far far too late. \n\nI finished my AA with a perfect 4.0 GPA, and my assumption was that I would be offered at least a modest academic scholarship package as a condition of my acceptance just like when I was applying to universities out of high school. FAFSA is able to cover the cost of my tuition and I have been reassuring my dad since we lost the house that a scholarship could cover my housing costs. \n\nUnfortunately, I found out yesterday that this university does not automatically generate scholarship offers for transfers, only incoming freshmen, and the two transfer scholarship applications had deadlines far before I was even accepted. I called the financial aid office to basically be told I\u2019m out of luck. So now, after thousands of hours of studying ridiculous hours seven days a week, my hard work is going to be rewarded with absolutely nothing because of my own procrastination and poor planning.\n\nIn addition, because it took so much longer to be accepted than I thought, securing on-campus housing is looking almost impossible. Even if I can get accepted, I now dont have any option to pay for it except for out of my own savings. I can technically afford it without loans, but that\u2019s pretty much all the money I have. My dad is willing to find us both a place to live near campus, but it\u2019s so difficult because the city of my university is extremely expensive and overpopulated. If we do find a place together, the rent is coming right out of my life savings too.\n\nI am at a complete loss. I have no idea what to tell my dad who has worked so hard to help me get through college. I dont know where I\u2019m going to live in 2 months. I dont know how to pay for my education. I don\u2019t even have any passion or excitement for the university I applied for, I just thought it would be a good way to get out of college quickly and with no debt. Now I have to come up with some sort of solution and I truly have no idea what to do.\n\nPlease help me.",

The reason it took this long is due to both medical and other problems I had. For my study (electrical engineering), my thesis needs to be on an R&D project I'm doing as an intern, and there's fairly strict requirements coming from my school (another reason why it took so long).\n\nBecause I've been out of the academic / technical loop for so long, I've forgotten a lot of math, programming skills and habits I formed during my 4 year study period. In my spare time I do watch a lot of technical youtube content which makes me retain at least some intuitive knowledge about engineering, and I've been working on a creative music carreer which helps me internalize signal processing to 'some' degree. Thing is, the intern project is going to be a c++ machine vision application with some pretty unfamiliar topics to me. Both the hardware and software in this project are looking very scary and I've just got a major sense of impostor syndrome. I know I'm a procrastinator / fast learner, but I just don't know if I'll manage to get up to speed this quickly.\n\nAnyone else have experience with this kind of break from academics?",

From the first day of college (because my parents say have told me since I was in middle school) I have had the mindset that GPA matters a lot and have tried hard to do well. And I have done well. \n\nUntil now . This semester I have put in more work than ever and I think I'm on pace to get 2 C's (Organic Chemistry II, Math Modeling).I fear I have reached the maximum of my work. I noticed lately that think very slowly and it takes me much longer to do an assignment than my peers. It didn't matter in Gen. Chem or Calc I and Physics but as classes have become real engineering classes and upper level math it has effected me. I like ChE but I just feel that I can't do well past the basic classes despite working even harder. I'm drowning in work and my slow pace to finish homework leaves me less time to study and I do poorly on exams. \n\nIv stopped going out. I don't drink anymore and I don't smoke anymore. Iv basically stopped exercising because I feel  so overwhelmed and barely have time as it is. I thought maybe I procrastinate too much and deleted Facebook, Twitter, Instagram ect ect from my phone. \n\nNothing has worked. Honestly the stress of this major is taking a toll on me. I am a shell of what I was mentally and physically coming out of high school. Looking around I don't know how my peers keep it together besides the ones who just cheat on everything. \n\nI know that was a long rant but I'm getting desperate.

        "post": "It's getting to be that time of year where high school seniors are being admitted into Universities, and next month transfer students will be admitted as well.  This is an exciting time, and everyone wants to do whatever they can to prepare in the best way possible.  Having gone through this process myself, combined with being an older community college student, I thought I should put together a little guide with things that you can do to prepare for your time in engineering school.\n\n\nKeep in mind that I am a mechanical engineering student, and some of my suggestions may not be applicable for your major or for your school.  The best I can do is put together a little guide that would have worked for me.  That said, let's get started.\n\n\n*  What kind of computer devices would you recommend, laptop, netbook, desktop, tablet?\n\n     This is something that is going to vary substantially, but I've found myself to work best with a laptop with a dedicated graphics processor (not a built in intel one) and a non-atom processor.  This allows me to run a solid modeling program like SolidWorks (will get into this more later) and being able to view models.  In terms of what brand laptop, I leave that up to you.  You will want something light and a good battery life.  I have a 15.4\" 2010 MacBook Pro and I use Windows almost exclusively on it.  Macs are popular, but few (if any) engineering software packages run on them, and no FEA (again, we'll talk about this later) packages are mac compatible as far as I can tell. \n\n    In addition, I have a desktop with a faster processor, dual monitors (you would be amazed how often dual monitors helps, they don't have to be large, but just having two of them makes all the difference) and a higher end (by higher end I don't mean latest generation by any means, just something that's come out in the last ~4 years and can play most modern games on decent settings).\n\n    This combination lets me do schoolwork at school, and then when I need to do something that takes some more serious processing power (some matlab code that has a ton of number crunching, or a complex SolidWorks model) I can do it at home.  \n\n     In terms of tablets, I occasionally see them, but frankly I've never thought \"oh a tablet here would be useful\".  ...I take that back, I wish I had a tablet for my last career fair to show off a video of a computer simulation I made of a [soda can being crushed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqs_J0zsf68).  I would never suggest a new student purchase a tablet to assist with their academic studies.  \n\n* Textbooks, digital/print, used/new etc etc\n\n    First thing first, books while they might be listed on the Syllabus are not always mandatory.  I've gotten through a number of courses without purchasing the book.  For my engineering courses though, I always buy the books and use them as references down the line.  So assuming you need the book, digital or hard copy?\n\n    Where digital books work:  GE papers where you have to read one book source and write a report on a topic.  An example, I took a politics of warfare course a year ago.  I had to read this ~400pg book and write an analysis about how France was brought into World War 1.  Instead of reading all 400 pages, I bought the book for the kindle, used the PC kindle reader, used the find tool and found every instance of \"France\" in the book.  I was able to put together a very thorough outline and despite my paper being 2 pages short of the \"minimum length\", I got an A with a comment \"excellent analysis\", as it was so thorough.  I saved myself a crap ton of time, by doing this and would recommend using e-books in this regard.\n\n    Where digital books don't work:  Engineering books just don't translate into digital versions well.  Often in my engineering books I'm flipping through chapters very quickly trying to find a specific chart/graph or something to that effect, and even in PDF format, I just can't go through the book very quickly.  PDF versions of the book can be useful when accompanying a print version in case you need to find a specific keyword, but that's the end of that.  Also, many engineering exams are open book, and that will be hard to justify use of your laptop/tablet during an exam.\n\n    Always buy books used if they're at all cheaper than the new books.  Rarely should you buy from your college bookstore, and instead buy from amazon.com, half.com or some other online retailer.  With my GE courses, I have always [resold them back to amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Sell-Books/b?ie=UTF8&node=2205237011).  I often sell back my engineering books and purchase an older edition of the same book (if there is a substantial price difference).  There is no reason to have the latest edition of a textbook on your shelf after you've taken the course.  Also, you might be able to use an older edition textbook during the course, this will vary from course to course based on how the professor runs his class.\n\n* Software Packages\n\n    A lot of this will be more useful once you've given your .edu email address.  For the purposes of this guide, I will assume you have a .edu email address.  I also do not condone piracy in any way shape or form, I am just referencing software that I use regularly.  It is up to each individual to acquire the software in a manner they see fit.\n\n   * [Sign up for dropbox](http://db.tt/PWFSnWVk).  The link posted is a referral link, and if you register through that link you will get 250MB of extra dropbox space on top of the 2GB you start out with.  Dropbox is an amazing service which a college student doing work on multiple computers, or collaborative work cannot do without.  It keeps all the files inside your C:\\Users\\ < your user name > \\Dropbox folder synced up across multiple computers.  You can also share folders within the dropbox folder with other people making collaborative projects/assignments much easier to manage.  If you register with a .edu email address, you will get a double referral bonus, so every time you refer someone to use dropbox, instead of getting 250MB, you'll get 500MB.  \n\n    * [Learn LaTeX](http://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/) if you want to make your work stand out from the rest.  [Here are a bunch of useful links](http://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/j2326/getting_started_with_LaTeX) regarding LaTeX.  A popular Windows LaTeX client is [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/).  If you hand in work/reports using LaTeX, you will blow away the graders.  Learning LaTeX is probably one of the best things you can do before attending college.\n\n    * MatLab must be had.  While it's impossible to just say \"install and learn how to use matlab\", just keep in mind you WILL be using MatLab, so do not shy away from it.  If you decide to go to graduate school, you will use MatLab there as well.  Some classes will require you use it more than others, but never, ever, shy away from it.  \n\n    * SolidWorks is a damn near requirement for Mechanical Engineers.  [Here is a link to their facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/solidworks).  I linked the facebook group because they periodically give away a educational software licenses, so you want to jump on that whenever you see that offer.\n\n    * AutoCAD Inventor is the AutoDesk alterantive to SolidWorks.  I've used it a little because I had to for a course, but I've found SolidWorks to be much better.  That said, it is FREE with a .edu email address, and [it can be downloaded here](http://students.autodesk.com/?nd=download_center). \n\n    * Some students also use [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and [Maple](http://www.maplesoft.com/), however I have never used them with any great frequency so I can't say much about them. \n\n    * Microsoft Office 2007/2010 cannot be avoided.  Yes there are other alternatives, however the features that Office provides are hard to beat, and not to mention if you will be doing any kind of collaborative work, you're going to want your Word Processor to match everyone else.  Learn the advanced features of Word and Excel.  In Word, learn how to reference stuff, and otherwise build your \"Works Cited\" page, Table of Contents automatically.  \n\n    * For collaborative projects where people must work on documents simultaneously, I highly recommend the use of google docs to build the content.  Then export the google doc to Word, and perform the finishing touches there.  \n\n    Now that I've discussed software, I want to drive one point home.  **Never** delete old reports, SolidWorks models, or any digital work of yours.  When you get close to graduation, you may want to built a portfolio showcasing your past work.  Always save everything.  I've had companies ask me for writing samples on a somewhat specific topic.  \"Sure no problem, here is a copy of my heat transfer design project write up\".  \n\n\nCommunity college transfers, each of you will have a unique experience when transferring into a University.  I was really apprehensive, but I found out that I actually had a stronger command of linear algebra, electricity and magnetism, programming and materials background than my classmates that were at the University from freshman year.  You will be competitive, however the roles of the professors will change drastically.  Be prepared to teach yourself more often than you're accustomed to (this goes for Freshman students as well), which is not necessarily a bad thing, however be aware of the change of the role.  \n\nThe other thing that I need to recommend is to not worry about studying ahead before a course begins.  The best thing you can do to prepare for your University courses is to go to school relaxed and well rested.\n\nWell, I should get back to the final lab report that I've been procrastinating on.  Please don't hesitate to ask any questions here.  I'm sure lots of other students will have matters to comment on as well.",

But I don\u2019t know if I have an \u201cengineering personality\u201d. \n\nAll the students around me are super practical, and smart, and know how to get work done, and even if they procrastinate, it\u2019s through worldly pleasures like partying, binging TikTok, etc.\n\nI\u2019m the exact opposite. I\u2019m constantly in my head, dreaming and having unrealistic fantasies. I procrastinate by just doing nothing, and thinking about the most useless crap, researching whatever new hobby I picked up that week that I will inevitably drop when the next one comes along.\n\nI\u2019m beginning to think maybe I\u2019m simply not meant to be an engineer, and that switching from a science major to engineering may have been the wrong choice. But I really do mostly like engineering school so far (even though I have below a 2.7 GPA).\n\nEdit: Yes, I am diagnosed with ADHD-C. But I feel like most others with it mainly struggle with the practical effects of it, and it mainly affects their productivity. For me, it seems to have shaped my entire personality. It\u2019s like I was designed to be an artist, or a homeless person, or a drug addict, or all three maybe. But engineer just doesn\u2019t seem to be in my genes.",

Copy problem statements->write down all givens->find and label relevant notes or chapters->write down relevant formulas->isolate what the goal is. At that point you have half credit for all the problems(depending on prof) then finish up by plugging in and writing assumptions/final answers.

However that is still a tall order being that nobody on the midterm except one person(bout 15 in class) got above a 70%.  Also being that the midterm was on dynamics of particles while the final will be on rigid body dynamics.  \n\nGoing into the final for deformable bodies I got bout a 70%.  \n\nHeres my gameplan-\n\nStudy until I am too damn tired and have to sleep\n\nStudy for 50 min, take 15 min break, repeat\n\nJust keep every hot girl thumbnail/EDM/Dubstep mix going while studying as it helps me keep going on long hours.\n\nDon't drink caffeine until 8pm\n\nhourly updates during every break\n\ntime to start\n\nEDIT:HOURLY UPDATES\n\nHour 1-started with general plane motion(my weakest topic), did 2 example problems from the book making sure I know where each step comes from, still kind of iffy on whole topic but next going to try problems on my own.\n\nHour 2-still confused on general plane motion, need to review on some fundamentals and watch some videos, this is the only topic that I still really need to grasp so after this should be easier/quicker review\n\nHour 3-getting better on general plane motion but still needs work, more problems ahead\n\nHour 4-got the general idea for general plane motion and can start problems, however still have trouble at arriving at the correct answer. Need a break from GPM and gonna review everything else\n\nUPDATE: My original plan was to study dynamics till I feel ready then study deformable bodies.  However the worst possible outcome that could happen is not passing both classes which could happen if all I do is study dynamics and neglect deformable bodies.  New plan is to start studying deformable bodies as I know that is a much easier course to learn as it is mostly just process based.  Besides General plane motion I have a good idea on everything else and I should be fine.  Deformable bodies I have the best chance at passing but also a very good chance at bombing the final if I hardly study.  \n\n\n",

It's designed to encourage consistent and manageable practice by sending a daily problem to your inbox. You can then verify your work with the linked solution, which is all free! Having worked at several Fortune 500 companies, I always found the lack of MechE interview prep resources frustrating, especially compared to our coding counterparts. So, I created this centralized platform to practice for my own interview rounds, and to continually refresh the undergrad fundamentals that aren't always used while in industry.\n\nI figured others could really benefit from this tool and avoid procrastination, so I\u2019m pushing an open beta release. I\u2019d love to get some input from the community on what you think so far, and where I should focus my limited resources on improving the service. There\u2019s no spam, ads, paid links, or upsell, and you can cancel anytime. Looking forward to hear your initial impressions.

I\u2019m just saying given the constant use of trig functions (at least for aerospace) they\u2019re used enough where having a special name for the inverse wouldn\u2019t be too absurd, given for exp(x) we say ln(x) for an inverse rather than exp^-1 (x). \n\nI've always hated writing out notation for inverse tig functions. Saying \"arc sine\" rolls off the tongue way better than \"inverse sine\" but writing them is literally opposite. one's six letters (too long for a handwritten function imo) and the other is short. Also \" \u207b \u00b9\" bothers me because trig\u00b2() is used so (cosx)\u00b2 = cos\u00b2x, but (cosx) \u207b \u00b9\u2260 cos \u207b \u00b9x. Literally this is only annoying because of how unsatisfying this is and also because I'm procrastinating.\n\nMy solution: just make it arc, ars, art instead for the fellas. So any time someone says arcsin as, or writes it as ars your inner child laughs and it saves like .634 seconds of writing you didn't want to do in the rushed lecture. I'm forever using this in my notes now because I am lazy, and engineering is laziness but done smarterer.",

Honestly I genuinely do like engineering (I enjoy tedious number crunching from time to time for whatever reason, for instance) but I've always had the problem of procrastination. As of right now I can only really say a few courses had material that was seriously mentally taxing, but otherwise I always find myself either having disproportionate grades (e.g. if a class has 3 unit exams and a final I might get A's on all 3 unit exams but bomb the final) or I always get something not necessarily related to understanding the problem/how to solve the problem like messing up arithmetic because I have concentration issues in certain aspects.\n\nThe obvious solution would be to just study more of course, but I feel like what I concentrate on is somewhat inefficient in the first place. I suppose a better question would be: has anybody had similar issues? Like having trouble with what is generally considered easier aspects of a problem but not have as much trouble with what may be considered more difficult or nuanced aspects of a problem? I try to not let others' opinions bother me and focus on self improvement but I feel like what usually happens is either my peers think I'm an idiot or they're intimidated to collaborate with me. Just been getting a little down on that recently and was wondering if anyone had something to say from an outsider's perspective.",

I'm currently taking Dynamics and Numerical methods and so far have turned in the assignments but they have been basically last minute. I also have some assignments coming up this weekend that I haven't even start, and it's not that I sit here and think eh I'm just gonna procrastinate. No it's literally I sit here and review and study for literally 8+ hours and retain absolutely nothing at all. Not to mention I feel like the questions especially in dynamics are absurd. For example, I just finished the ODE course at the school last semester and we never did anything higher than a 2nd order differential equation. Literally the first homework he asked us to solve a 3rd order diff EQ... I was able to solve it eventually but it took me like an hour of research and study to find the solution. I just got back from a one week vacation at a friends house out of state and that did help me boost my mental a little bit, but I'm already back to the miserable state I was in at the end of last semester... I just needed to vent... I gotta go review this shit now .-.",

I tried online courses but there are so many and they don't do it exactly like my prof does. Problem is I don't even understand what my prof does.

Last year, in my physics and calc courses, I didn't do any exercises. About a day before the exam, I studied very hard and did the exams. I got some pretty good grades for the effort I put in.

However, you have put in the work towards that degree and you should feel proud of that.\n\nSecond, do not sacrifice a social life for a 4.0. To be perfectly honest a 4.0 does not magically unlock a great job or anything really. It just proves you're good at school and that has little to do with real life. If you're not personable you're probably not going to get hired, simple as that. Sacrificing for a class that is 6 months of the 70ish years you got on this planet isn't worth it. Also your GPA might not be the end all be all. I managed to get into a good graduate school with a sub 3.5. That said you better keep it above a 3.0 to make life a lot easier. \n\nThird, don't be so wound up. Everybody knows your degree is difficult, you don't  need to remind people or talk shop. Time away from study and class is time not to be spent on school.\n\nFourth, learn time management. Sorry to keep banging on about this but if you manage time and kill that procrastination itch your life is much better. I wish I had figured this out before my junior and senior year.\n\nFifth. If you can study abroad, Do it. You learn so much from not only the similar classes but from the culture outside your home country.\n\nAnyway good luck to those entering engineering. You'll probably enjoy it or switch to business.\n\nSee ya around.",

I've struggled with depression and anxiety, lack of a social life after all my friends left and went to work all over the country and never reach out to me first anymore. My fiancee cheated and dumped me. I started failing classes completely, finished half my final year but the remainder...\n\nI try studying for days on end and it takes me 2 hours to do a simple control theory problem that should take 20 minutes. I've gone over this work years in a row now... I don't even procrastinate as I used to, I just sit and stare at the work and want to cry and tear my head open and stop existing. I have no motivation or belief in myself left and this semester is again going badly, got 12% on my last test.\n\nI've started therapy and medication for the anxiety/depression/attention. I tried different environments: on campus, at home, with music, without music, etc. I tried making notes and reviewing, I've tried focusing solely on solutions to the problems but I just forget half of what I studied and then can't finish a single question because I run out of time. On top of that I'm so stressed I become nauseous and sometimes hyperventilate, this starts while I'm trying to study already and continues sometimes for a day or two afterwards.\n\nThis is the last chance I have to finish before the last 8 years of my life have literally been wasted, and even that hasn't kept me motivated. Everyone around me from my therapist to my parents to the one friend I have left keep telling me to not give up, \"You're so close!\", \"It would be stupid to drop out now\". I somewhat agree, but yet I don't believe it and the encouragement that feels fake to me just makes me feel even worse, like more of a failure and disappointment to my family.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this and how did you overcome it? Should I just quit and go do something else? I am at the end of my nerves and energy.",

        "post": "I was an artist and an author my entire life. I hated math, hated STEM, was bad at all of it except for algebra. I scored nearly perfect in all areas except mathematics on my ACT, which was so bad it dropped me a good 3 points. \n\nGrowing up, I always knew I was going to major in something other than what I wanted. My passions weren\u2019t profitable unless you happened to be one in a million, and I just didn\u2019t have the work ethic or drive. I chose engineering because I knew it would pay well, that it was a reliable job, and that it would make my parents proud. \n\nWhenever anyone asks me why I\u2019m an engineer (unless you happen to be a recruiter, in which case because I love problem solving and innovating the future) I tell them money and security. Because truly, engineering has pushed me to my limits. I had to learn how to go from studying 1-3 hours a week (if that) to achieve perfect grades in highschool, while never having taken any honors or AP courses, to having to grind all day every day solving math problems that I have no interest in. \n\nIn exchange for my social life, most of my happiness, free time and sanity I have maintained a 3.6 GPA for almost two years. I do what has to be done, but not a second goes by that I don\u2019t feel totally unqualified and incapable. Most of the kids around me grew up taking things apart, investigating computers and gadgets, taking advanced STEM classes or being raised by engineering parents. Besides experiencing none of these things, I was given a pretty traditional upbringing as a rural female: barbies instead of legos, dresses instead of puzzles. A lot of my peers who know I\u2019m only in it for the material have given me crap. They think I should be passionate about my degree, that I\u2019ll never make it if I don\u2019t like what I\u2019m doing, etc etc. \n\nFeels bad man. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what this post is about. I\u2019m just feeling discouraged after studying statistics for 4 hours and understanding nothing because I haven\u2019t been to class in weeks. Truth be told, I don\u2019t want to work. I\u2019m not really passionate about anything anymore, I just want to have enough money to live well, take care of my family, and chill.  I skip class too much and procrastinate nonstop, I\u2019m just waiting for my poor study habits to catch up and yeet my scholarships and therefore my degree. \n\nI guess I was just curious if anyone else struggles like I do.",

        "title": "Graduated ME last Spring and got a job. Here are some tips and advice for those of you still in school. Good luck!",
        "post": "After 4 long years, I graduated in May and landed a dream job of sorts here in NYC doing construction for a very large company as an ME. I was pursuing full-time positions since November of 2018, applied to 100+ places, attended a few job conferences, and interviewed roughly 12 times resulting in 2 offers in the month of July 2019. My stats are as follows:\n\n* 3.6 GPA\n* 3 Summer Internships\n* 3 Student Officer Positions\n* Aerospace Oriented Senior Design Project\n* Volunteering, Fraternity, and Mentoring\n\nAlright, enough humble bragging. I figured it might be helpful for you guys to benchmark yourselves. Here's some stuff that greatly helped me during my degree:\n\n**Textbooks & PDFs**\n\n* \\[REDACTED\\] PM for more info.\n\n**Online Resources**\n\n* [http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)\n* [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/index.html](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/index.html)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/structurefree](https://www.youtube.com/user/structurefree)\n* [https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html)\n* [https://www.chegg.com/](https://www.chegg.com/)  (split an account with someone if you're broke)\n\n**General Advice**\n\n* Go to class. Feeling lazy? Go to class. Hungover? Go to class. Going to be late and miss attendance anyway? **Go to class.**\n* Add all of your class schedules and obligations to your Google **Calendar** or equivalent service. Being able to glance at my watch when a class or meeting was coming up and knowing exactly where to head to on campus was invaluable for not going crazy.\n* **Meet people!** Networking is incredibly misunderstood on this sub and in the engineering student psyche. Most people think that talking to people is a waste of time and that everyone is selfish on their own path. If you're genuine and make the effort, most people will meet you halfway. That upperclassman who you became friends with and invited you to work on his club project sophomore year? Oh, now he works for GE and can write you an awesome letter of recommendation. That's just an example. Get to know your classmates, club leaders, guidance counselors and advisors, TAs, professors, internship managers, career office coordinators, etc.\n* Have some **fun** and make friends for life. Yes, it's not illegal to go out a few times a month to be social and enjoy college. I know people who managed very high GPAs who were able to party and have a great social life. I can't recommend Greek life enough, but only commit your Freshman/Sophomore year, after that it might be tough to balance after classes start to increase in difficulty. Invite some of your classmates out for lunch, get creative.\n* Keep in mind who will be your \"**crew**\" from an early point in your college career. As the classes converge on the 300/400 level courses in each degree, you'll be taking classes with a lot of the same people from semester to semester. Get to know them and find your niche. This helps incredibly when it comes time to study, choose groups for projects, and eventually form a senior design team.\n* **Redundancy**: backup *everything!* Imagine spending 12 hours on a SolidWorks design only for your hard drive to crash. I personally had all of my school files including notes, textbooks, excel sheets, MATLAB, SolidWorks, practice exams, PDFs, etc on a flash drive, external harddrive, laptop harddrive, desktop harddrive, and Google Drive (set up Google Drive's free Backup & Sync tool to all of your devices so your cloud backups are seamless).\n* **Have a course/degree plan by semester**. Depending on the resources at your school, certain courses may only be available at certain times or may be closed before you're able to register. Plan out 2-3 different trajectories for your degree by semester and credit until you graduate so that you are prepared when the night of registration the school website tells you to fuck off when trying to register for that important class.\n* **Sleep and Diet**: you won't be able to function without these. Pulling all-nighters may not seem like a big deal but after a while, it adds up and you *will* feel like shit. Try and get at least 7-8 hours a night. Fall asleep and wake up at the same time everyday regardless of class schedule. Eat well, try to cook, minimize shitty meal plan food and take out. Plugging /r/EatCheapAndHealthy. In addition, take it easy with drugs and alcohol. It's not a bad idea to have a drink 1-2 times a month to chill and hang out, but your brain needs to be operating at maximum efficiency in order to succeed. If you could cut these out completely, that's even better.\n* **Group Studying**: This one was really hard for me to get into taking into account my personality but it was so worth it by the end. For some courses, it will be impossible to absorb and understand 100% of the information expected of you. With group studying, you all can cover different areas and teach each other what you understand best. An added bonus is that with the material you feel most comfortable with, by \"teaching\" others what you know, you'll actually become more confident about the information anyway. Not only that but you hold each other accountable to study. It's much easier to flake a solo study session compared to a situation where 2-3 others are relying on you.\n* **Student Engineering Organizations**: Join one, even if you're a freshman. Every minute that you procrastinate joining one you'll regret. Some common ones at most engineering schools: SAE, ASME, SWE, EWB, etc. Google the club list for your school and email them *now.* I joined one freshman year, put in a lot of time, and by sophomore year had the title of Vice President. This was an awesome addition to my resume and I became extremely close friends with intelligent, driven people who now work for great companies.\n* **Software**: know how to use the tools necessary to complete your work. Whether it be Excel/VBA, Python, MATLAB, SolidWorks, ANSYS, AutoCAD, etc. Becoming proficient in these not only enables you to work smarter and not harder, but it also gives you pertinent skills necessary in the world of engineering. There is an abundance of resources available online to learn these proficiently, or you could reach out to someone who already knows how to use them.\n* **Office Hours**: More useful in some courses more than others but if you don't understand something, you might as well go directly to the source before trying other options. Most professors feel proud to share their knowledge in a more intimate setting. You might even make a great connection with them leading to a research opportunity down the line granted you do well in their class.\n* **Email**: Please know how to write professional emails. It will help when contacting professors, TAs, recruiters, school staff, managers, etc.\n* **Resume/CV/LinkedIn**: Even if you're a freshman (put stuff from high school), always have a resume ready. Set up your LinkedIn as well, it landed me a few interviews. You never know who you'll meet and who you could share it with. Contact your school's career office and make an appointment.\n* **Have a Genuine Goal(s)**: Why are you even in engineering school? Because your parents told you to? Because you wanted to make money? *Switch majors now.* If you're in it because you have a passion for it, you're honestly going to enjoy it despite all the hardships. Do some research on what you want your degree to accomplish for you. Want to do Data Analytics for Tesla? That's a goal, now aim for it. Want to be a structural engineer for Boeing? That's a goal, now aim for it. Want to design cutting edge prosthetics and biomedical devices for the disabled? That's a goal, now aim for it. If you have an end game in mind, everything moment to moment will feel so much more worth it. Even if you don't have an end goal and are winging it, take the next few weeks/months to ***really*** figure out *why* the hell you're in engineering school.\n* **Internships/Coops**: apply to them. I don't care if you're only experience is half failing Calculus 1, the least you could do is apply. App season is usually from September-December depending on the company for the following summer. I'd apply to at least 15 each year. If you have a network of professionals, reach out to them and see if they can squeeze you into anything. [USAjobs.gov](https://USAjobs.gov) is also a great resource if you want to go public sector. Your school's career office is also something to be explored in this regard. Getting a fulltime position without work experience or at least research experience is going to be pretty difficult. If you can't get anything, keep chipping away at your resume (student clubs, tutoring, volunteering, etc.) until you land something. This is a journey you start immediately, the number of freshmen I met who thought internships were an upperclassmen only issue was puzzling. I had a summer internship all 3 summers, so can you.\n* **Financial Aid/Scholarships**: apply for them. It couldn't hurt. Google is your friend. Make sure you have your parents' tax information handy if you're still dependent.\n\nAll in all, good luck to everyone! I wish you all the best. Engineering school was the best experience of my life so far and I'm going to miss so many aspects of it (and others not at all hahaha).

Three whole years plus all the money, down the drain. And now? I'm left with nothing but regret and a sinking feeling in my stomach.\n\n I've always been passionate about computers. Since I was a kid, when I got into B.Tech, I thought I was set for life. But boy, I took \"No one studies in college, It's all fun\" too seriously. I've spent time procrastinating and scrolling mindlessly through social media than actually engaging with my studies. And now, as I stand on the brink of my sixth semester(we total have 8 semester,my 6th semester started a month ago), I'm filled with nothing but regret.\n\nBut here's the thing: I refuse to let this define me. I refuse to let three years of apathy dictate the rest of my life. I want more than just a mediocre existence\u2014I want to excel. I want to land a killer job in the tech industry. I want to wake up every morning feeling excited about the work I do.\n\nSo,  here's where I need your help. What should I do? How can I turn things around in my final year and make up for lost time? how do I silence this nagging voice of regret and self-doubt in the back of my mind?\n\nI'm ready to put in the work, to hustle harder than ever before. I just need a little guidance to steer me in the right direction. Any advice, encouragement, or tough love you can offer would be greatly appreciated.",

I got slammed with a ton of school work during the semester and family issues and i kept procrastinating on them and it is my fault for not getting at least a few in early. \n\nI have a 3.0 GPA in comp sci and I will likely graduate in fall of 2023 since I transferred and essentially wasted a year doing classes that didn't count towards my major. I haven't had any projects to add to my resume and all the clubs for comp sci at my school have basically just relegated themselves to playing video games together since the pandemic started. \n\nIm going to start grinding out leetcode on a daily basis to prepare for coding interviews and to perform better overall in my classes, but Im at a loss for what to do over the summer. Should I try to get a TA job over the summer with my school  and go to as many hackathons as possible to beef up my resume with my comp sci related things. Or should I just grind out lots of internship applications and hope for the best?",

        "post": "*Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is the right place for this question so you may see this cross threaded somewhere else.* \n\nI'm 25 years old, did not go to college straight out of high school out of fear of debt and procrastination. I spent the last 5 years working low pay retail jobs and barley making any money. I'm finally ready to accept I waisted my 20's and I'm far behind my other schoolmates who are now graduating and starting dream careers.\n\nI was the type of kid who always tinkered and took things apart, always into video games and computers, wanting to learn how to jailbreak iPhone and root androids. I was the go to kid to fix malware on laptops for my family and friends and I'm still the family \"tech guy on call\". I'm just not sure how to apply this to school and make it useful towards a degree. I thought about programming but figured I wasn't good enough at math. I'm working on that through some free online courses.\n\nMy last job before the pandemic was a customer service job answering emails for a high end handbag brand. The emails were a no brainer but I was more interested in making the software work for me to make my job simpler. I would go through the software and change settings around and create short cuts that the company wound up keeping permanently. One of the tech guys said I was was most certainly in the wrong field and should look into help desk. I cant tell if what  I did was just something simple anybody can YouTube and figure out or if I have imposter syndrome and i'm actually capable of doing the things I dream of.\n\nMy ideal career would be me working in a nice office space within my own area, working from a computer maintaining system and network function and solving issues as they arise. Bonus for the ability to work remotely. I've used VMware type products and business enterprise products and taught  myself a few tricks while working in the call center.\n\nSo my main and most important questions are. How do I take what I have and expand my knowledge in school. What would be a good career path to choose? How do I chose the right major to suit my needs? Also what are some good resume tips so I can apply for jobs that give me experience while i'm in school? Thank you for any and all advice!\n\n*eddit* sentence structure.",

So I majored in mathematics and science and completed the classes I needed to earn credits for the CS major of my transfer school, the college I go to currently. Unfortunately, when I started here last semester in the fall and havent even been to campus yet. I was really hoping to use the school as a way to expand my resume, add teams I joined or events I participated in. I dont even know, I just feel like my resume is incredibly lackluster and was hoping that could help.\n\nI see these people on linkedin who go to actual universities, some of which are god tier schools. And their accounts are packed with incredibly interesting things they've done or experience they've gotten. Im a junior and I feel like I got nothing. I dont even feel confident about applying to internships because my resume only has random job experience. Im currently a computer tech but its still nothing much compared to others. I try to do projects but it feels like theres no time. I work part time, I take 5 classes, as soon as I get caught up in my interests, I fall behind and im already a huge procrastinator. I really have no idea what to do to stand out\n\nMy original plan since I go to such a basic college, was to do as many internships as possible, small ones even as long as I have experience, make a few significant projects in fields Im interested in, do research with a professor at my school or possibly another if they let me. Try to maintain good grades. Then I graduate, I get a job for two years, go for my masters in either computer science or stats from an actual good university, then try to find work in a more respectable company if I hadn't already.

        "post": "Hello, this is a throwaway account as you can probably suspect from the username as I will talk a bit about my life that I am pretty ashamed of. I will have a tldr at the end also.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI am currently in my last year of college/university and for my first 3 years, my courses has been online due to covid. Online courses and having to stay at home has been \"great\" for me as I wasn't forced to go to class and I get to indulged in my favorite hobby, playing video games. As someone who loves to procrastinate and have little self-control, I ended up mostly playing video games for the last 3 years while learning minimal amount of stuff. How did I passed my courses will minimal effort? Assignment/projects were either google'd/looked at lecture/copied from Chegg into my own words (if available) and exams were online, so google/lectures were my best friend. I did fail a few, but I retook them and passed. My GPA is pretty trash I would say also, roughly around 2.5-3 (pretty big range, because I feel so ashamed to look and find out my actual GPA). In the past few weeks, I realize how much I screwed up my life as I am graduating next year (if I do not delay it) and I know that no company would hire me. Even I would not hire myself, because I know I don't deserved to be hired currently. With these thoughts dawning onto me and I started to make changes in my life.\n\n**My plan now:**\n\nI completely stopped playing games (deleted all of them) and also spend very little to no time with friends that I used to game with. I started going to the gym and working out as my new hobby. I stumbled onto this forum which I thought was great to make my study plan:([https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/623011/A-guide-for-dummies-(like-me)#:\\~:text=To%20start%20with%2C%20you%20have,and%20then%20other%20languages%20follow](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/623011/A-guide-for-dummies-(like-me)#:~:text=To%20start%20with%2C%20you%20have,and%20then%20other%20languages%20follow).)\n\n1. My \"best\" programming language is Java so I plan to work with that more and re-learning some materials listed in there. Also I am getting ahead in my assignments (with the help of google/lectures still, but I work on it myself first), so I can better manage my time and work on re-learning the materials asap.\n2. After I re-learn, I plan on working on 3-4 personal projects since I have none right now that I can put on resume.\n3. I plan on applying to as many co-op/internships as I can and work on leetcode problems that have been suggested in another forum that I looked up already.\n\nI am not sure if this is a good plan, I know I don't deserve any sympathy or pity, but I want to swallow my pride and ask this community for some advice/tips (Like is this a good plan? What else should I do? etc). Sorry for wanting to go a bit in-depth of my situation as I want to show my sincerity and also show that I am working on being a better version of myself. I am very sorry if the wordings is a little rough as I am thinking about a lot of things.\n\n\\-----\n\n**tldr:** Barely learned anything last 3 years due to lack of self-restraint on video games. Now realize the issue and trying to fix in my last year. Fully quit video games, started working out as a new hobby, and re-learning Java materials. Plan on hopefully landing a co-op/internship before I graduate and was wondering if anyone have some advices/tips for my situation.\n\nI am in Canada (not sure if that makes a difference, if it does I am still interested in any advice so I can see if I can apply it to myself) and thank you very very much for your time. I appreciate any feedback and even if you don't, I still appreciate your time again. I hope you have a lovely day/night.",

        "post": "**TL:DR** Originally when I typed this question, I was wondering if graduate school was worth it...but now I am just wondering, has anyone did poorly in undergraduate and eventually find themselves happy with their choices they made afterwards? What's your story?  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nThe main reason I want to go to graduate school, I would love to learn more about my field and even feel more confident in myself. I feel like the programs I make for college is worthwhile too and things I won't come up with on my own.  \n\n\nThe main reason I don't want to go, it left me with a long lasting imposter syndrome in my head. My GPA was a 2.6, but I tried my hardest and used every resources I could (TAs, office hours, and textbooks mainly).  Yet I would either find TAs who believed I was milking for answers, even though seeing TAs were the second to last resort followed by office hours. Spending a large majority of my free time working on assignments. Constantly feeling helpless because I can't find some solutions to issues to my problems either online, from TAs, in the textbook, or waiting outside in long lines to see the professor. Submitting uncompleted assignments because I ran out of time. Only having a few hours to study for exams because I have programming assignments due that are also worth a huge part of my grade. Also no, I didn't procrastinate or wait until last minute for assignments, I used my time to work on assignments that needed to get done, prioritizing the ones that were due soon. I felt like part of me passing some classes was just luck, either I got an easier professor, or I met someone who was willing to help. Most of the time, everything felt really cut throat because none of my peers would want to help, because if I did better, that means they could get a lower grade due to the curve...  \n\n\nAfter graduating I felt like my degree wasn't deserved. I felt like maybe I didn't belong in the major. I tried learning some things on my own, or using new technology, finding myself getting frustrated at things not working, flashing back to college days remembering how much of a failure I felt and thinking I am still a failure...even though I am only doing programming because I want to be less of a failure...but I end up dropping them and spending my free time playing games or browsing the internet because I am happier then doing a project and thinking about how much I suck. Lots of times I think if I ever go back to college, I would want to go in another field instead of graduate school for CS.  \n\n\nI got lucky with my job, it was an internship I got through my brother and then got hired once I got my degree. But I don't feel like it's deserved...before covid I was commuting 2 hours one way for 2 years because I felt like no one else would hire me, nor did I feel like I had the knowledge to get past an interview when I got them. I felt like I didn't deserve the job, I feel like I don't know enough to contribute and make any impact, and I don't go searching for other jobs to expand my knowledge of because of my self doubt.  \n\n\nI look at my peers and they are really knowledgeable, and some of them don't even have a degree...  \n\n\nDo you relate, and what's your story?",

        "post": "Alternative title: I landed my first job and now it's *my* turn to wax poetic about the rocky road that got me here!\n\nI'll try to keep this brief, but will fail. Just know that it could have been longer.\n\nEight years ago, I decided to change majors from computer science - which I'd always wanted to do - to something completely different. A year later, I realized I'd been lying to myself. It wasn't my major that was the problem, it was a mix of immaturity and foolish behavior that sent me in a downward spiral. I overscheduled myself in an attempt to graduate early despite not knowing what I would do after graduation. I ignored problems in the hopes that they'd go away. I didn't know how to study, procrastinated far too long, and actually doing homework was a constant mental battle with myself. These things compounded one another, and I slowly devolved into an anxious mess. I alternated between too proud and too scared to ask for help, and didn't use the ample support available to me. Unsurprisingly, this didn't change after changing majors, and at the end of my third year of college, I returned home with my tail between my legs.\n\nWhile I could go on about my mistakes and how I could have avoided them, this isn't really about how I screwed up. It's about how I clawed my way back. I lived at home and worked in a coffee shop for the better part of a year, repairing a relationship with my parents after two years of eroding it. When I built up enough courage, I moved back to the area to be closer to the woman who would become my wife, living with friends and working another dead-end job. A year later, I found an entry-level IT (helpdesk) job through a couple old friends from college, and suddenly my flatlining life had a new trajectory. A few months later, my wife found her first full-time job, and suddenly we actually felt financially solvent. We weren't making anything to brag about, but we spent conservatively and saved liberally.\n\nI was starting to feel like a competent human being, with a modicum of time management skills, and started applying to schools. In my application to the \"other\" major public school in the area (not the one I'd previously attended), I wrote a much longer version of the above, combined with how I'd grown since and was ready. It was really the first time I'd verbalized what I'd put myself through and analyzed it, and sharing it with my parents felt like opening up in a way I never had. Writing that was truly a big step for me, but turned out to not be enough for admission: I'd tanked my grades too far.\n\nInstead, as recommended by the admissions counselor, I did part-time online classes at the local community college to raise my GPA. After three semesters, I finished an associate of arts and was able to transfer to the state school. Thanks to a combination of my generously flexible employer, I was able to keep working full-time and have a full-time class schedule, and for the first year - two semesters and a packed summer term - I did it all from the same chair due to COVID. I took 45 credits in that first year, and returned to campus last fall for a chaotic semester: 16 credits of upper division CS with an inconsistent schedule, and logging into work from campus between lectures. That earned me a nice and easy spring - just two classes and plenty of time for job searching.\n\nI really hated job searching, but I'm elated to be able to say it's over. I accepted a fully remote offer with $150k TC, which was not the number I expected, and suddenly I feel like I can catch up to where I would have been had I done things right the first time. Had I graduated six years ago, I would have ended up at some in-state company making good money working on something generic. Instead, I was able to pursue remote positions at tech companies that, unwilling to move across the country, I never would have looked at in 2016. Even if I had, I wouldn't have expected much attention as a student at a midwestern satellite campus that's further north than over half the population of Canada.\n\nBut the point of this isn't the money, or even that there are opportunities I wouldn't have had - and might not have explored now - if things had gone as planned. The point is that it's possible to crash and burn without ruining your life or your career. I have a lot of different takeaways from my experience, but in the interest of not rambling more than I already have, here's the big one: you don't need to do this alone. I had all kinds of support from my wife, my parents, my in-laws, a wonderful manager, other family, friends, and of course my dog. I was very lucky in a lot of ways, but ultimately cleared the bar by a lot (for example, I could have left my job and we would have been okay), so don't read this and think the planets need to align in order to enable the end result. I don't know how many people thinking about returning to school visit this sub, but I think the same general ideas apply for anyone struggling like I was. Use your support structure. Ask questions. Take control of your own education.\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading, and I'd be happy to give more detail if there are questions.",

What I mean is my health is somewhat in the shitter but I have a decent career and did decently in school. \n\nI am a swe 1 at $BIG_TECH and I interned at another $BIG_TECH before. I know it's not as impressive as citadel or the places that some people here work, but at least I'm proud of my job. I work remotely and make 122k tc from my parents basement in a mcol city. I would have never imagined that I would make this much money sitting in my basement all day. I feel not good at all though. I would rather honestly be making 60k tc and be pain free. \n\nAt the start of college I was pretty skinny and was 140 lb but completely unfit. I'm glad I picked up lifting though and now I'm at 175 lb with decent numbers but I got fat as well. Now I have hip pain from sciatica and sitting all day to type or look at something on the computer is very annoying and I cannot sit for more than 10 minutes at a time. If I don't lift weights regularly the pain becomes unbearable.\n\nI also completely did a team project by myself in my algorithms class meant for four to five people over the whole semester but in 3 days. I started getting mild hand pain but finishing this project was too important for me and it was pretty interesting too (about advanced graph algorithms to count isomorphisms in subgraphs). This mild hand pain turned into full-blown carpal tunnel in both hands. So now I have hip pain and hand pain. The reason this happened is my friends and I were grinding on side projects all semester and procrastinated on the actual big project. I got the project done and got the highest grade out of all groups in the class but I completely regret it. \n\nIt is manageable day to day if I exercise and stretch but my performance is probably impacted 20 to 30% and the mental burden and fear of it becoming worse is always there. \n\nPadding up your resume or finishing that last LC code question for the day is not worth having to deal with pain constantly. Two of my friends who also work at Big Techs deal with hand issues. \n\nIf you notice any numbness or tingling in your hands or back just stop. I got a 3.65 in college and probably like a 3.9 major GPA. I would have gladly taken a 2.8 GPA if it meant I didn't have to deal with pain all the time. \n\nObviously I've been to the doctors about this and they just suggested wearing a brace at night and stretching for both conditions. I am very glad that my conditions are manageable enough that I don't have to go through surgery. \n\nI feel like if I didn't grind that much in college and focused on doing more cardio and stretching or something and not working till my hands hurt I would be in a much better place right now. I hope none of you trade your health for TC. Also please sit properly in ergonomic position.",

I also suffered from lack of motivation, nothing pushed me, not family, friends, ex gf, nothing gave me a motive, I have my dreams/wishes and desire to reach my goals but nothing pushed me at all, and I always thought I'd end up being a low lifer and a loser and just imagined my life will go downhill and I will be a waste of a human. But I started reading \"Atomic Habits\" and it started to give me a kick, I did not exceed the 55th page for so long like couple of times but I do know that this did click something within me. That is why I decided that I do not want to be a loser but a winner, to eventually reach my desires and goals, whether they are money or else. I do not know how to fight everything but I try but looks like nowadays I am going backwards and not forward at all, I began making the monthly/weekly/daily plans but did not stick to any, I started Datacamp course, I enrolled in CS50x but did not start any. I just have the feeling that I would wish for a mentor to invest in me so someday I could reach my destination, but at the same time I want to fight that urge, to be strong enough to be self-driven no need anyone to push me because even if someone did it will be temporarily.   \n\n\nI see a lot of motivating posts on this sub, successful stories about people landing good jobs and of course others who might not be so lucky, but of course all of this is minimum 3-5 years ahead of me, I have multiple ideas of what to do after college, some are taking a year to improve my overall skills if I make it to this point and to be good enough to land my first job and from there to start the hopping technique. Other is trying to train on myself a bit then hatch on a Master's degree in ML to be able to go into DS or atleast attempt to work in ML after college and Master's or whatever. I just feel lost and found at the same time, maybe a bit overwhelmed maybe not, I do know that if I sit on my ass for a day I could figure it out and then start executing, but it is not that easy for me.  \nI have never been that smart hard working kid, I was always and still am procrastinating.  \nI am not saying that people do not, but I am beyond normality, confirmed by many of my procrastinating friends. I exceeded sane limits, like not giving a damn if I miss a deadline, skip exams in college, just screwing everything and like whatever, I am trying to fight a beyond recovery level, trying to fight my inner battles and my bad habits while trying to improve other fields and yet I feel like I am falling back, I do not know entirely how to make it work, or maybe I do and I just act like I dont as an excuse, I just wish I could be able to fix my life and go on the right path to my goals and someday I can come back here writing my success story like everyone else.  \n\n\nI started and stopped for damn's sake my own journal on Google Keep documenting my daily events but stopped doing it a night or 2 out of tiredness then just procrastinated entirely. I want to set my plans and attempt to execute them.  \n\n\nI do know  I am not the only one like this, tbh IDK if my post will get removed, but I want an advice from the people who made it. Like I wish to be able to make a post about my journey in this career and I wish I could motivate others, I want to leave something before my time comes to motivate and empower others who suffer like me from their demons.  \n\n\nHow can I improve my life and work on my skills at the same time as a CS student, I decided to retake the fundamentals from the pros (CS50x) because I do seriously lack everything even though I made it through exams to my 3rd year. I am supposed to have one year exactly to make it because next summer should be the one I take an intership to be able to graduate, then my 4th will have 2 projects then graduation and THEN I will be out to real life and if I am not ready, oh I am afraid it will be messed up. I do know some people restarted late in their life but I have responsibilities ahead of me I do not and cannot fail and restart later, I want to be able to make it right early on, I am 21 going into 22, I will graduate 24, and if I am correct and lucky I will land my first job almost hitting my 25th if I got it couple of months after graduation all depending on my skills at the time.  \n\n\nI find interest more in ML I have a relative in Google Lens, so that's my interaction with the field through them. I was taught python/C/Java but of course all are meaningless because I did not practice and forgot them all.  \n\n\nI know my post is too long, could even be removed, but I did take time to write this and vent about my issues, but I did it here in hope similar people could relate and advice me as this field has many people who procrastinate and yet make it, but my case is rather unnormal, going through life with some problems within myself and not just being a lazyass it's hard to fight everything specially while trying to do multiple things at the same time, attempting to make a habit of going to the gym and currently not doing it well, reading books to improve my mentality and to learn more about how to improve myself, journaling my day-to-day, enrolling in courses to improve my skills but not even starting them. I just feel like I might lose it all again and I consume energy trying to stay sane and not letting everything go away because time is a double edged sword, and currently it's edge is going through my body rather than being held in my hand, and I am afraid it might kill me before I could use it for my benefit.  \n\n\nI hope I find some advices and help from you good people and also help the post itself doesn't get taken down.  \n\n\nThank you a lot if you managed to reach this point of reading.\n\n  \nFellow CS student.  \n\n\n(Was posted on CScareerquestions but due to new account, karma is low)",

I just get so bored and know that I am hardly ever going to use the material after finishing the course, so it's hard motivating myself to put in the effort in the courses. I also work an overnight job and go to school in the daytime, so when it comes to a choice between my electives and sleep, I almost always prioritize the extra sleep. Any pointers to keep myself motivated throughout the week, so I'm not stressed trying to cram a whole week's worth of work on the weekend? Going to post in r/college as well, but wanted to see if anyone has similar problems here. Thanks in advance!\n\nTl;dr: demotivated to complete elective coursework which leads to procrastination and unnecessary stress.",

By all the posts I see on here of the form \"applied to 100 internships and finally got an offer, hang in there!\", I must have gotten really lucky. Honestly, I half-assed when it came to applying and networking for internships because I didn't want the stress added. I wouldn't recommend slacking like I did, waiting to apply, procrastinating, not going to career fairs, etc.\n\nJust wanted to make a quick post because I'm genuinely excited and thankful for the luck and the decent offer. Wish everyone else still looking for a summer internship the best.\n\nThis is my last semester of classes and the internship is a graduation requirement, so end of summer I'll have by degree. It's been a slog lol\n\nI'm going to message the recruiter and see if they can get me in touch with my mentor/dev team so I can ask what tech stacks I'll be working with. Then I plan on studying them before I start so I have so skill/familiarity and am not completely lost lol",

        "post": "This is going to be a long and descriptive post so if you actually take your time to read every minute detail, I appreciate it deeply because I\u2019m pouring a but of my life on the internet when I\u2019m a private person.\n\nAbout Me: \nI\u2019m currently a community college student taking one class that is Pre-Calc, that\u2019s online and currently failing, badly. I\u2019m in my early 20s and working full time 40 hours. I graduated high school several years ago and all I\u2019ve been doing is working on and off though out the years. I want to major in CS but I\u2019m leaning more towards Statistics because it does involve more math. I was going to drop the class but I wanted to power through it to prepare myself for Calculus next semester. \n\nHow I did in school:\nNow when I was in school, Math was always my favorite and highest performing subject. I was usually an A or B student. I did have some Cs and Ds but I was more focused on making people laugh or screwing around a lot rather than my work. I remember clearly one year in high school where I was not doing well in my math and science class, I just didn\u2019t care at the time because my mind was on other things. My science teacher saw my head leaning at the back of the class because I was sleeping, he gave me a private pep talk about life and to take this class seriously. After that semester I achieved a 4.0 with me being the top of my class in both the same math and science classes. I\u2019ve also looked at my test scores, student evaluations from teachers, and other aspects in my years of school, math has been the most prominent class. I went to my college tutoring center and I feel a bit ashamed because that is something that I wouldn\u2019t have done before. When I was in school I would talk to my teachers about questions but I don\u2019t recall going to a tutoring center. \n\nWhat I regret:\nI deeply regret not taking advantage of my math skills. The one thing I remember telling myself was, \u201cWhy am I so good at something that is so useless\u201d? I still remember that to this very day and I oh so wish I can go back in time and just tape my mouth shut from ever saying that. I deeply regret not capitalizing on what I believe is my passion.\n\nMy situation:\nI\u2019ve made recent posts about this and thought maybe I lost my math skills or something. But now I believe it\u2019s A.) Online classes are not for me and B.) I\u2019m getting overwhelmed with the workload while working full time. The way my online class works is that my professor gives 3 HW assignment sections with a video and I have to turn it in by the end of the week. I was thinking to forget about the first month of sections that my professor gave out and just focus on the sections now and move forward. But I keep thinking about the other sections I have not completed due to me not procrastinating and having poor time management. That and every time I go to work and study after work, I get some kind of cognitive overload because I\u2019m dealing with stuff at work then I come home and try to study but I still have some of my energy thinking about work. Like right now I don\u2019t have work, other than some errands and chores my day is free. I\u2019m excited to go back to those boring problems because that\u2019s just what I like doing. But when I get off work and try to do them, I\u2019m fatigue as hell. Now I don\u2019t want to lose my job because I need the money. I also think my brain works more sharply in the morning than compared to late at night. \nAlso, online classes are not for me whatsoever, when I did go to tutoring, my brain was more stimulated because I was actually there and in a different environment with other students and such than just in my room. Tutoring helped a lot more than just the video, even googling some stuff helped. \n\nThis post seems a but unorganized but I wanted to give a good amount of detail about my situation. If you need more detail I will gladly supply it. Again, if you read the whole thing I thank you from one anonymous person, to another. I\u2019m just lost, frustrated, worried, overwhelmed. This is something I believe is for me. My brain and heart attracted to this. I just need guidance.",

I see a ton of doom and gloom on here constantly but some advice floating around.\n\nI\u2019ll keep it short; what should I do?\n\nI like what this field is, I\u2019m starting my first coding class next week, I\u2019m pumped, I\u2019ve done a bit of practice and watched some youtube clips but nothing major. Should I be working on major projects on the side? Anything specific? What sacrifices do yall recommend I make? My overall goal is to work as a game programmer. Money isn\u2019t a huge deal to me and overall I\u2019m not sweating this too much, but I want to do it right. \n\nEdit; I\u2019m an online student. My classes are all year long. Does this change anything?  \n\nAlso thanks yall for these nuggets of information! I\u2019m gonna start doing leetcode today. And I\u2019ll speak to my advisor about internship and see what the prerequisites are for the school just in case. ",

        "post": "Hi everyone. I'm currently 20 years old, and am struggling to decide what path I want to take. I have seen plenty of YouTuber's who are self-taught and plenty who have gone the more traditional college route. I understand that there are pros and cons to both options.  \n\nI have never been the best with school, struggling to make due dates because I procrastinate. I have done two udemy classes by Colt Steele, and they were great. I feel like I would do better teaching myself. The one thing I struggle with making the decision is how valuable is a college degree to companies hiring software engineers. I have done research about programs in my state, and I feel that I can learn a lot more if I teach myself in the same time as a bachelor's degree.  \n\nWould like the hear people's opinions, and their journeys to becoming full time developers.",

The first thing I said in the interview was in response to a \"how are you?\" and I responded with \"I am fine, however my allergies have been acting up today.\" This was noted.\n\nWe proceed with the interview - note that the person on the other end doesn't have their camera feed on. I go the whole way through until I noticed something at the very end. I had decided to double click on my video feed out of pure procrastination and that there was this running line of snot coming out of one of my nostrils, and I only then noticed and apologized. The interviewer was very polite \"Don't worry about it, happens to all of us!\" but I can't help but feel like I am going to go onto the HR system as \"**Snotface**\" or that they are still joking about that on slack right now. When they are deciding on candidates, I bet they would be like \"Oh candidate B did well on this but look at the subroutine the **Snot person** wrote.\"\n\nI was so embarrassed.

        "post": "Sorry if the title is too vague; this is sort of a mess and I couldn't think of a better name for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey friends,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm finishing up my second year of software engineering studies (would've gone with computer science, but the unis here generally don't make a distinction between the two). So far, it's been quite a fun experience, but I've got a couple of questions that have been bothering me for some time:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Due to my lifelong problems with various forms of mental illnesses, I failed two first year classes (namely, Computer Architecture and Algorithms) AND two second year classes (Numerical Algorithms and Nonlinear Optimization) AND failed Computer Architecture again this year. Luckily, my uni is forgiving enough that I should be relatively fine if I pass Algorithms and all other second year classes The medication has been working wonders for the past few months and doc and I are pretty optimistic that things are finally getting better in the old brain department. However, I still have to pass eight whole classes (five from this semester, three from last (although for those I only have to do final exams) + Algorithms from the first year), most of which I've either slept or drunk through. Now, that is surely just a matter of working hard enough, especially as I DO have enough time to mop all of those up, but looking at all the work that has to be done I can't help but feel immensely afraid and helpless, not helped by the fact that it's now a month until the semester ends. So, I guess my question here is: has anyone else had a similar experience? Do you have any advice beyond just plain hard work?\n2. During the years of my infatuation with computer science in general, three broadish areas have distinguished themselves as my main interests: low-levelly system programming (operating system development, distributed systems etc.), programming language and compiler theory, and finally machine learning (mathematical/theoretical aspects of it moreso than strictly practical stuff). Now, I realize that during my time at uni I WILL be subjected to all of those subjects in amounts sufficient to nudge me in a particular direction, but I would really like to begin specializing earlier; if I change my mind later during my education (or life for that matter), I doubt I'll regret my decision to learn something new rather than wait till I can finally 100% decide where to go professionally. All I've been doing for the past several years is making plans for what to read and do, then seeing something fascinating from another field of interest, then shifting to that field and making plans for how to study it. Rinse and repeat. Being stuck in that loop of almost-not-procrastination is, to mildly put it, infuriating. I'm not asking you to decide my professional orientation for me; just - how to overcome the initial hurdle of \"hey, everything is amazing and I want to know all aspects of it but I can't since everything else is also amazing so I have to know that first\"?\n\nI guess all this is just my naivety speaking; this has probably been asked in some shape or form thousands of times before - still, I hope you can look past my vague ramblings above and indulge me.",

        "title": "6 Mistakes to Avoid when Preparing for Coding Interviews",
        "post": "Disclaimer: I\u2019m the person building a tool which helps people learn how to avoid these mistakes.\n\n1. Not putting in the time\n\nIt seems like an obvious pitfall to avoid, but you\u2019d be surprised how many candidates make this mistake. If you\u2019re serious about preparing for interviews, you need to put in the time. Some individuals choose not to invest the necessary time, but the reward makes it well worth the effort. Think about it this way, securing an offer can lead you to an average pay increase of $20,000 or even more, especially if competing offers are in play. Treat your interview preparation as an investment in your future. Besides, if you fail an interview, most companies will require you to wait for another 6 months before they consider your application again.\n\nThe amount of time needed to practice varies for different roles, but at least devote extra time to truly understand the starting easy problems for each topic in the tool I\u2019m building. Subsequent problems use a similar pattern to solve, so they become easier once you\u2019ve grasped the initial concept. Aim to get to a point where you can assess most problems quickly and efficiently. This could look like receiving and evaluating the problem and almost immediately being able to come up with 1-2 different approaches.\n\n    \n2. Memorizing answers\n\nAlthough it\u2019s tempting to search up a company\u2019s list of interview questions and memorize dozens of interview questions, this approach often leads to failure. Interviewers ask open-ended questions or nuanced follow-up questions to assess your problem-solving skills, so they\u2019ll notice if you\u2019re not able to explain your thought process well.\n    \n3. Not practicing with a plan\n\n\nIf you\u2019re just doing random Leetcode questions, you\u2019ll likely overwhelm yourself and after struggling for the second or third question, you may become so demotivated that you\u2019ll procrastinate from prepping until a couple days before the actual interview. This is why many candidates end up struggling during interviews \u2014 they didn\u2019t prepare with a strategy. Each interview question can be systematically solved, so as long as you understand and can identify the general pattern of how to solve these problems, you\u2019ll be able to work your way toward a functional solution in the context of that problem. This is exactly why I\u2019m building this tool, to help you learn the *patterns* of how to solve coding problems so you can strategically approach questions in a way that will allow you to articulate your reasoning well. It groups problems with similar solutions together, so you can familiarize and practice the same approach with different questions.\n    \n4. Not understanding your own plan before coding\n\nWhen under the time pressure, some interviewees hastily dive into coding a solution without a thought-out plan. They end up making mistakes, wasting precious implementation time, and not completely providing a working solution. To avoid this, take the time to thoroughly understand the question by considering edge cases, identifying a simple input/output test case, and then explaining your approach as if you\u2019re explaining it to a child. The solution should be simple to understand, so both you and your interviewer know what direction your solution will take. Verbalizing your approach will also allow you, or even your interviewer, to identify potential flaws in your solution. This is why, before writing the code, the tool encourages you to think of potential clarifying questions as well as the output of an example test case.\n    \n5. Refactoring the solution before finishing implementing it\n\nIt\u2019s always best to first provide an explanation of a naive solution before thinking of a more optimal solution. If you\u2019re not able to think of a more optimal approach, then take 5-10 minutes to write the naive solution so you at least have **some** working implementation. Once you begin to write your implementation, try not to focus too much on optimizing or improving your code until you have a finished solution. Otherwise, you may risk running out of time because you were too focused on refactoring your code.\n    \n6. Not learning from mistakes\n\nIf you fail to solve a question, then it means you\u2019ve identified a weak point in your interview skills, so not taking the time to reflect on your mistakes is passing up an opportunity to make yourself a stronger candidate. Identify what specific decisions or approaches led to your missteps. Did you not spend enough time in planning your approach? Did you use an incorrect data structure or algorithm? What decisions prevented you from finding an optimal solution? Identify what factors led to your errors so you can avoid similar mistakes in future interviews. The tool allows you to flag the problem you missed, save notes for why you missed it, and see when you last tried the problem. Revisit the question again in two weeks to see if you learned from your mistakes.",

        "post": "I go to a t5 cs university in the U.S. I'm taking an intro python class. Throughout the year I have continuously did things that are counter intuitive to my learning and now I am in a situation where I need an 86 on the final in order to get a B in the class. A C would be legitimately the worst possible because I would be inches away from losing my scholarship. An 86 doesn't seem terrible considering it's an intro python class but here's the problem the exam is this coming Friday and legitimately I only have a bare bones understanding of python and when I say bare i mean bare. We've had 10 homework assignments with 5 coding problems on it and the last one I did on my own without chat gpt was homework 2. It all started with an extreme amount of procrastination. I said that oh I'm just using chatgpt once I'll catch up but I never did and ever week I messed around and didn't focus and so now here I am. If you asked me to solve any homework after HW2 I would fail to do so and I've failed both midterms meaning if I don't get an 86 I get a c. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've told myself over and over that I would change but I have a problem where I just let myself escape by doing anything but work so when i look back at the weeks that have gone by I realize just how much time I've wasted and I feel like a complete fool. Even now here I am still procrastinating and so now I have to ask where can I go from this. Procrastination is a habit that has been engrained in me since high school I've always been smart enough to screw around and still get high A's which is how I got into this school but I've been completely unable to do that here and so whenever I got a little anxious I would avoid everything and bam another day has gone by and no work is done. \n\nI keep rambling but this is probably one of the worst cases of procrastination in my life. It feels like the walls are collapsing and because of how insurmountable everything is I feel like I want to learn but because of the vastness of content I just don't know how I'd go about this and so I continue to escape. If I continue on my foolishness I'll end with 3 A's in easy classes and a C in Cs my major and a B or a C in calc which the same situation is occurring only difference is I have one extra week to study. I've been a complete disappointment to myself, my parents, and my goals and all I want is a restart but even then I feel like it's a self fulfilling prophecy I've always said to myself I'll make a change on procrastination but each time I got away with but I always felt like if i look back at my life (18 yrs) I could've done more with everything yeah i got into a t5 but I could've been even better. \n\nI feel like if I don't figure something out I'll fuck around until friday and fail the exam and fail the class so now I am at my wit's end and I'm essentially begging anyway to tell me is it possible to learn enough to get an 85 on an intro python course in one week or six days. All I know right now is just some stuff from lecture like I went to lectures but I never learned to actually implement anything so all I've got is random words floating through my head and half thought out concepts. Is there anyway i can do this in a week i've got the time if I essentially didn't stop studying for each day. Can anyway tell me what to do with my problem and where to go from here and how I should go about studying what resources I could use and whether it is possible. I've regretted what I've done everyday and each day I feel the weight of existence pushing down on me and I hate my life right now. I've never been under this much pressure and I just need to succeed but nothing is looking good so what do I do. I always use any distraction to escape the feeling of dread I feel whenever I wake up not any substances but going to parties, yapping to people about nothing, and just general avoidance.\n\nHere is our curriculum:\n\n \n\n1.

        "post": "I'm currently a computer science student and have trouble managing hard classes - I'm a second year and I'm approaching that part of my degree where the content becomes noticeably more difficult and time consuming. \n\nI struggle a lot with procrastination and time management (something I'm taking active steps with working on) but I want a way to do this more efficiently. \n\nPersonally, I do great on assignments and projects - but I don't do very well on tests. I do experience testing anxiety but I also feel like I haven't figured out how to properly study. Any tips on studying for exams would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI've had to retake a few classes because of dropping them for these reasons. However, I do have a passion for CS and programming that I pursue through my projects, which landed me an internship for next summer.\n\nSo I'd say it's not a problem with liking my degree, it's more of a problem of not knowing how to handle hard classes very well. Especially as I'm going to be taking harder classes in the coming semesters, I'd love some advice on how you all study, what to do when you experience burnout, how to lessen testing anxiety, etc.\n\nAnother huge cause of me dropping classes or not doing as well as I hoped is because I have bad luck with taking horrible professors. Obviously I also blame myself - but this past semester I've had professors who can't speak english very well and professors whose grade distributions made it very easy to shoot yourself in the foot (one of my profs this semester had 80% of the grade distribution dependent on 3 exams). So I'd say this is also a big factor.\n\nAnother question is how many courses do you all usually take per semester? My dad tells me to take five but I feel my limit is four; I do see my friends in the same major taking five which makes me feel like I should be doing the same, but I'd like input on this as well. Thanks everyone.",

        "post": "I'm currently a first-year computer science student at UC Irvine, and I'm in my second semester here. Ever since 10th and 11th grade, I've been really interested in CS, and have made comprehensive plans to learn web development or machine learning, etc. and build said cool projects with them and get internships. However, I've also had a really poor work ethic, and would procrastinate school work so much so that I barely had time for those things. I wanted to get into competitive programming or data science competitions too, and I didn't do that too. Worse yet, I would cheat my way through high school. I basically cheated my way through AP CSA, Data Structures, Discrete Math, and Calculus. I got the credits for these classes by taking exemption exams that I cheated on, and being placed in high level classes right now, but I have no idea what I'm doing. A lot of these projects seem really convoluted to me, and I cannot do something as simple as reverse a linked list or perform depth first search. \n\nI see kids who've actually learned a lot about coding in high school, people who've done really cool side projects, and gone really far with competitive programming, etc. While I sit here not knowing basic data structures and OOP taking higher level classes than many of them, I cannot help but to be consumed in regret. I wish I had the problem solving abilities and the stuff that they've done, and I get so insecure whenever I see Githubs of my friends, and my Github is pretty much blank with maybe one or two tiny projects in the past 3 years. What sucks is that a couple years ago, I had so much ambition to learn so much about CS, and do so much, and I just killed it. I feel like a blank slate, and my sense of achievement is tied to what I've done. I've had to lie on my resume a lot to make up for the fact that I genuinely have done nothing, I don't even have the base knowledge big tech companies are expecting. I cheated on my OAs and did horribly on all but one interview, that was only because barely any technical questions were asked in that one interview. \n\nI want to become a problem solver of their level, and have build really cool projects, stuff that's cool enough to get me into a big tech company. I want to get an internship at a reputable company and excel without cheating my CS classes by the end of this year. \n\nI know this is all my fault, and I hate myself for cheating like this and not doing the work. I get stuck in regret cycles and have struggled to take action for the past 2 years. But I just want to move on from it, relearn the fundamentals I missed, build cool projects, leetcode, and get an internship at faang or something similar by the end of this year. This is not a shipost. I just needed to get this out because I'm too ashamed to tell anyone about this. I know I'm a smart guy, and I am good at learning things or developing problem solving skills rapidly, but putting in the work has been really difficult for me. \n\nAny advice on how to go about this?",

He's pretty encouraging and chill, and has a good sense of humor in class (he's a prof. too!). \n\nI'd be lying if I said I wasn't slightly intimidated by this whole thing. This has completely shifted my day-to-day lifestyle, although for the better. I guess because this is something I both want to do, and has stability, it feels very relieving and comforting. As much as I could preach \"enjoy the journey\", I would never go back in time to re-experience trying to discover what I want my career to be. (Being a teen is fucking hard)\n\nBut now that I'm here, I feel both scared and extremely grateful. Scared because this is just a completely new path for me (and I have a lot of math to catch up on). And grateful because of the support system I have. I was honestly feeling pretty tense when I walked into my first CS class since I was one of the only women in there: Complete opposite of my gen-ed classes and past major. But the vibe was chill, people were nice, and I even joined discord server for my uni's CS majors. And it is HILAROUS. It's 40% people panicking about homework they procrastinated on, 40% shitposting/memes, and 20% studying advice. Perfectly balanced lol. \n\nI'm also thankful for my parents and brothers, who encouraged to rise to the challenge of taking on a completely different major and overall are just really supportive in every way. I think they are the reason why I am now more willing to accept the challenges that come with being a CS major. \n\n:)",

        "post": "Most CS majors really want to be a software engineer and are grinding and struggling to get their first internship. I have 9 months of internship experience so far and another 3 months of internship this summer at a F50 level company. My experience so far is leading me to think I should stop pursuing software engineering as a career path.\n\nI've been struggling a lot to get my work complete (read: missing deadlines) even though I know exactly what I am suppose to do and it is relatively easy (compared to what I've done on my own before).\n\nI can think of a variety of reasons why this may be the case: working from home with entire family, difficulty separating home/work life, working in an online setting where I am 3 timezones away, lack of interest in project, lack of control over project (unlike my personal projects). Feels like I spend more time day dreaming about doing other things than my actual work. Once I remember what I need to be doing, I spend so much time catching up on what I was doing before I started daydreaming and don't make much progress.\n\nMaybe working from home feels like homework that I keep procrastinating on? Work from home deadlines don't feel real? Is this adhd (along with a bunch of other factors in my life)? I don't know. But it's been incredibly frustrating trying to get myself to work. I feel really bad because my manager is kind and patient but I just keep missing the mark and feel like I'm disappointing everyone because my manager keeps reiterating how important the internship project is to impacting the rest of the team. I also feel really bad that I'm getting paid so much and getting almost nothing done week after week.\n\nSo yeah idk, **does being a software engineering intern get more enjoyable IRL? Or easier to focus on doing what you're suppose to be doing at least?**\n\nWhat's interesting is that I really enjoy coding. I've made a lot more progress on personal projects outside of work than my actual work. It's just for whatever reason I can't do what I'm getting PAID to do.\n\nSo now I feel like I need to find a new career path after I spent so much time working on a CS degree and have this much job experience.",

I don't like CS; I got into the career 'cause 3 years ago I didn't have the EQ to say no to some family members. I came to terms with that fact on dec 2022 and have been going through a process of accepting it (I'm going to therapy for that and other unrelated things).\n\nJust for context, I get fairly good grades and until now have been able to manage programming-related assignments. However, taking free time to dive deep into programming or technical skills is hell for me, and now it's not as much a matter of procrastination (I'm no saint and it has been in the past), but of it being astonishingly taxing for me - I'll be miserable for a long time if I pursue SRE or Prog-heavy roles.\n\nOn a disclaimer fashion: I know IT is no fools' field. I'm aware it's hard and that there's a frenzy all over the field, all over the jobs, all over the career. I also know it is not realistic to get an IT job without programming up to some level and I will probably not find a desired position here. This post is me coming to terms with that. I already know what I want to do after uni (getting to uni again on my desired major), but I cannot let 4 years and a lot of money go to waste.\n\nThe career has not been all doom and gloom. I can say that I really enjoyed learning about database design, SQL and other minor topics.\n\nFollowing that line of thought, question is: Would DA be a good career path choice for me? If not, do you know of any non-tech-heavy field that may be worthy of looking into to make a decision?\n\nI'm mainly considering DA and Data in general because I want to pursue a science-related field an to become an investigator, write scientific papers, etc. I'm interested in the transferability (is that a word?) of statistics, the communication skills (which I'm not good at), the math (which I enjoy way more than I enjoy writing code) and its relative lightness of code (DA-oriented Python and SQL)... Other than that I'm experiencing burnout...\n\nI'm putting the mindset effort.\n\nThank you for reading this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Typo",

Are y'all kept fairly busy at your internship to where you don't have a lot of down time, or do y'all have times where you have some work, and you procrastinate a little lol?\n\nRight now at my internship, there are times when I am working, then I procrastinate for a bit, and then get back to whatever I was doing. I usually do this if I understand what I need to do and how to do it, but I also do this so that I don't burn myself out and think more clearly.\n\nIt is a bit weird for me since I am given tasks with no specified deadlines, so I try do the work to the best of my ability, but I also \"procrastinate\" every now and then to keep myself from burning out if that makes sense.",

        "post": "  As someone who considers himself the ultimate procrastinator, I've spent years searching for ways to overcome my tendency to waste time and finally achieve my goals.   \nToday, I want to share with you the life-changing method that has worked for me, and I'm confident it can help you too.    \nIf you're a chronic procrastinator, I urge you to try this method and come back to share your results because this will affect your life and fix most, if not all, time-related issues you have - this really works!   \n\n\nThe key to stop wasting your time lies in controlling your screen time. There are two essential tools you'll need: your smartphone's screen time feature and a laptop app called Cold Turkey.  For iOS and Android users, set a daily 30-minute limit for social media and other time-wasting apps. On your laptop, use the Cold Turkey app to block distracting websites. To ensure you don't cheat, give the passwords (in iOS devices cases, it's an Apple ID and its password that you cannot recover whatsoever) to a trusted family member or friend who will only grant you access when it's genuinely necessary and take it back after you've completed your task.    \n\n\nMore details below if you are interested!",

        "post": "I know Reddit is probably the last place I should be right now with midterms right around the corner, but alas, here I am. I keep getting into this procrastination cycle and I need to break it.\n\nI have been a procrastinator since I was little, which really sucks now because I never learned the good study habits when I should have. I would joke around, play video games, hang out with friends, go on social media, and then study a few days before the exam in high school and usually be fine... not great by any means, but I got by. Then in undergrad I would \"study\" every day, but in reality, I was scrolling reddit, on social media, and taking breaks for 20 minutes that soon turned into hours. Again, I would study very hard right before the exam, and was able to do well. In my first year of medical school, I did the same thing. I would scroll through social media for hours while studying, do a few anki cards, determine that it is too late to start a new Boards video or unsuspend new AnKing cards, and go to bed, only to start the whole thing again the next day. I was able to pass all of my exams, not super high scores, but a pass is a pass, and I was usually right below the class average.\n\nNow I am in my second year and we have our midterms next week. I have been doing that same cycle of procrastination, and now I am panicked, and I dont know what to do. I really dont feel like I can catch up. I know I am very confident and very comfortable with the material with which I have actually studied and spent time on, but there is over a weeks worth of material that I have not even looked at yet and I need to know.\n\nI know there isnt much I can do right now, other than buckle down and study and then study my ass off for the final, but on our next system block, how can I avoid this cycle? I hate being locked into it. What have you guys found helpful to hold yourself more accountable?\n\nThings I have tried:\n\n\\- Currently prescribed Adderall, works wonders\n\n\\- Pomodoro- I am not great at holding myself accountable after the 5 minute break is up\n\n\\- App timers for social media- I would end up just putting in my password to stay on Instagram\n\n\\- Deleting apps from my phone- I reinstall them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks guys!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I didnt know what flair to put on between Serious and Well-Being, so if I should change it, let me know!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- Not sure why this has been downvoted... Legitimately asking for help here and downvoting only hurts the chances that this will even be seen... Hopefully it gets upvoted again so someone can help. ",

        "post": "M4, in peak interview season. I feel since I applied and more so for the past month, I have not wanted to do anything academic or scholarly related or even med school work related. I'm on a research elective and I have zero motivation to even carry out the work. I told myself with this free time in M4 I'd focus on improving my weaknesses on clinical knowledge so I don't crash and burn in intern year (applying IM) but haven't started that either. I'm not depressed as I don't feel sad at all and don't meet SIG E CAPS except anhedonia.\n\nFor the interviews I've been on, it feels like such a chore to prepare for them and I've just been winging most of them. I fake the enthusiasm and extrovertness during interview days and once the day is done I can't wait to go home. I have my main programs that I'm actually interested in coming up so I know I'll prepare for those but even then I tell myself \"I don't want to do any of this\" when I sit down to prepare. I don't think I've ever been this lazy in my life and I'm not sure why. I definitely still have interests and it's not that I don't want to do anything at all. I'm playing more video games now that I have the time, got back to a consistent diet and exercise routine, and looking forward to reading books and catching up with friends (and sleep) this winter. But I will admit most of the day does go by with me just browsing the internet on fb, instagram, youtube. Basically procrastinating my tasks until it's evening and I tell myself I'll try to do it first thing in the morning. The research elective I'm on now, my PI, expects me to put in work and finish a pub (which probably won't happen because I honestly don't care about the project but need these elective weeks to graduate), and then couple of other clinical electives which I already don't want to do.\n\nNot sure if anyone else has felt this before or is feeling this right now. I don't know if I'm burnt out from med school or from academic stuff but kind of nerve-wrecking knowing the real work in residency will be here before I know it. Amazingly weird considering how just two months ago I got up every morning and put in work for my sub-I day in and day out and now I can't even read a journal article.... Any advice appreciated.",

        "title": "How to Survive SOAP - lessons from someone who went through it last year",
        "post": "A year ago I opened my NRMP email to find out I did not match. Further background below. I want to touch on a couple of take always from my experience in hopes it will help at least one person. If you are a loved one wanting to know how to support someone going through SOAP, I included some notes below.\n\n**If YOU are going through SOAP**\n\n1.) **Process it.** As much as you can. Go through all the stages of grief and remember its cyclical in nature. Rage, scream, cry, feel the numbness. Distract yourself if you can. You MUST reach a place where you can acknowledge this result is NOT a measure your worth as a resident. You may not believe it at the moment but you must at least KNOW it. You are your biggest advocate in this whole situation and you NEED to reach a point where you believe in yourself to go through this and find your path. You will be unable to interview or write a convincing new personal statement if you do not know in your heart YOU ARE WORTH IT.\n\n2.) **Call two people in no particular order: your advisor, and at least 1/2 people who you consider are your loved ones and/or biggest support system.** This is a big moment in your life. If you are a person who has trouble reaching out for help, you have to realize this is probably one of the few times you MUST make an exception. You will need help and support to get through this. Call your advisor and find out your schools resources to help you through this. Who are people who can write you a new letter of recommendation? Do they have resources for writing a new personal statement? Are there options to put off graduation? Then for your loved ones: call them, tell them what happened, explain what you will be going through the next week so they can help support you and know what's going on each day of this week. Its worth it to explain it to a select few. It is exhausting to explain to more than 2 people which is why I advocate you find the 1-2 people who will really be there for you every step of the way.\n\n3.) **Stay off social media.** If it involves exposing you to your fellow medical students' posts, don't go there. Exceptions for places like tiktok or insta stories if you use them for distraction/entertainment/distraction. Comparison will rip you apart, you need to focus on YOU and YOUR situation right now.\n\n4.) **Go eat something.** Make something for yourself, doordash something, or go to a restaurant for eat in/take out. Bonus points if your loved ones can join you and help distract you. You will need your strength. During my Monday of last year, I was so miserable I felt like I didn't deserve to eat. There are wonderful folks on here who are sending pizzas to people who are having a rough day today.\n\n5.) **Go grocery shopping.** I know, it sounds silly but this is going to be a LONG week. You need to camp out and buckle down. Make sure you set yourself up for success.\n\n6.) **Sit down to discuss your options.**  \\+/- with your advisor or loved one. Whatever will be most helpful to you. Write down your different options and discuss your pros and cons. Decide what you're willing to sacrifice and what you're not. Mine last year for my particular situation was\n\n\\- SOAP into a transitional year (pros: same specialty, cons: moving again, going through match again, one more year of an already long process, etc.)\n\n\\- Change my specialty to FM/EM/Peds whatever has lots of categorical openings (pros: high chance of matching in SOAP, maybe some crossover with the specialty I originally wanted, cons: saying goodbye to my specialty of choice.)\n\n\\- Try and apply to one of few categorical positions in my specialty of choice left in the nation (pros: keep traditional timeline, cons: high gamble on a program that went unmatched - why did they go unmatched?, very small chances)\n\n7.) **Do the work.** Enlist your loved ones to help you through it, whether its being in the same room as you, cooking for you, checking in with you, or even guiding you through step by step, its time to write that personal statement, figure out what programs you want to apply to, etc. Take frequent breaks if you need to, but make sure you do it, DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. You will self-sabotage any chances you get. Let your loved ones and/or advisor keep you accountable to the work you need to do.\n\n**If YOUR LOVED ONE is the one going through SOAP**\n\nIt's going to be all hands on deck. Make sure you understand the SOAP timeline and what your loved one needs to accomplish every day. It will be pretty busy almost all five days of the week this week. Interview calls can happen at any moment. Help keep them feed, hydrated, distracted if needed, and help them through the work if they're experiencing the feeling of being a deer-in-the-headlights. They are going through an extremely demoralizing time, please please be sensitive to what you say, and know that you may see behaviors you've never seen before in your loved one as they go through one of the hardest days of their lives. DO NOT hold it against them. They have put so much blood, sweat, money, tears, and years only to hit this obstacle. Be present, and use your intuition to know what your loved one needs the most.\n\nBackground: I had about \\~13 interviews and 5 auditions. I felt both interviews and auditions went well and even received honors on multiple evaluations and yet.... Pitfalls were probably a weak Step 1 and a competitive specialty (surgery). I did decent on Step 2, Level 1 and Level 2.  I honestly don't know what happened but I've made my peace. It was just me, no significant other to consider when relocating, already moved away from my family. I got very, very lucky and matched into a categorical spot. One year later I love my colleagues and am receiving a great education. I'm not a huge fan of where I live but I'm doing the work to find the things I love about being here.\n\nFinally: You are worthy. This is a broken system. BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. You did the work, you have the desire, you want to do this so, so bad, I know. Whether you know it or not, this WILL be just another obstacle in your overall journey and one day you will look back at this day and know that for certain. Shitty things happen to worthy, deserved people when you're working within a broken system. Even people who did match today will not be immune to that as their journey moves on. It doesn't mean you're shitty, it means the system is.\n\nEdit: grammar",

        "title": "[Well-being] [Step] Seeing my counselor about procrastination actually changed my life",
        "post": "I've always been well disciplined and did well on tests, but I was burning out faster than expected M1-M3 years. I didn't realize *it didn't have to be this way*.\n\nI always said I was open to seeing a counselor, but deep down, my pride got in the way. Then Covid happened and it pushed to me to see our school's counselor. I knew about the different counseling styles but it never clicked for me. Then I tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Turns out it's high yield for a reason. And I think it's great for Type A's like med students too. I'm so glad our counselor is a pro at it.\n\nI went from studying 10+ hours a day for average shelf and step 1 scores to 6-8 hours of studying for high self scores and an 80th percentile step 2 ck score. But most importantly, I feel so much happier overall. That M1/M2 bitterness is slowly melting away. And now I see entirely different career paths that I'd enjoy.\n\nThe next step is applying this to work I don't enjoy. It'll be a lot of work, but I know it'll be worth it in the long run. If you're feeling burned out, or simply would like to enjoy studying more, I highly recommend seeing a counselor for this!\n\n**TLDR: CBT should be declared a neurotic med student's best friend**\n\nFor anyone curious, some key points I took from counseling:\n\n\\-Counselors are great for checking your blind spots, and you'd have to be pretty damn arrogant to deny you have blind spots.  \n\\-Doing things because you want to has been repeatedly proven to be more effective than forcing yourself to do it in the long run (i.e. raw discipline for things you \"should\" do)  \n\\-Center yourself so you can really identify what bothers you (which is surprisingly hard to do)\n\n**Edit:** Ultimately the goal is to improve my well-being and condition myself to enjoy the work. Then I can more efficiently learn. E.g. I can do Uworld at 90%+ effort now for like 4 blocks, while before I'd go half effort all day.

        "post": "Hello! I am an M2 student that should currently be studying hypertension and anginas, but procrastinating on reddit per usual.... Anyways as always COVID is one of the trending topic in the front page of reddit, and it got me thinking about what is the information that has antivax people believing in Ivermectin so much? So I just googled \"Ivermectin mechanism of action\" expecting to find nothing, yet found this paper published on nature. I glanced over it and some of the things stated confused me based on what I've learned so far and was hoping someone could help clarify for me. From my knowledge TLR4 is for LPS and some times activated by tissue damage, is it really possible for a virus to activate this pathway? A lot of the alleged action of Ivermectin is heavily based on it being able to block TLR4 which is something i never really learned about, (only learned the anti-helminthic MoA) i glanced the cited paper and it did seem to increase the survival of LPS induced death in mice by 50%. I don't want to do a whole lot of research on this because i need to study cardio, but I'm just hoping someone with more background can school me on whether this is true or not and give me some insight. Some of my non medical friends believe this stuff and if they shows this to me I'd like to be prepared.  Much appreciated!\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41429-021-00491-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41429-021-00491-6)",

        "title": "[Preclinical] Need Advice: How to GET stressed",
        "post": "Hi Everyone!\n\nI am a current MS-1, so I am starting off with a largely online format (Thanks COVID-19).\n\nIn undergrad I was a big procrastinator, and that has sadly transferred over to medical school. I am still passing, but by a huge margin (get upper 70s, lower 80s) on my exams. And the problem for me is that I just don't really start work until the impending test stresses me out (like to the point where 2 weeks of the system block that we are on has passed, and I have barely done around 3/\\~20 lectures that we were supposed to have done by that point, since the test still feels far off (\\~1.5 weeks away).\n\nWhen I do feel the pressure of the exam (\\~ 5 days before), I can do 7-8 lectures a day and finish them before the exam. I know this is bad, and I want to fix it. I tried to plan out how much I want to do the night before, but that hasn't worked, since I basically tell myself \"ehh there is still so much time left today, I'm fine\" and then eventually when its too late \"ehh there is still so much time left until the test. Ill be fine\", which I know in hindsight that it is the wrong mentality, but it has been hard for me to overcome those thoughts in the moment.\n\nI guess the ideal solution to my my problem is to find out how to cultivate the self-discipline to do work even when I am not as stressed about it. But failing that, how can I induce that stress to force myself to start studying seriously earlier than I do?",

        "title": "Medical School and my (lack of) Free Time and Hobbies",
        "post": "Edit: This text is going to be long. It's about a bunch of my personal issues that sweltered during my med school time and especially during corona, and I feel like there's a somewhat happy ending in sight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh well, there's been quite a bunch of stuff I've been thinking and worrying about in the past few semesters and I feel like it's time to share.\n\nBack in High School, I had quite many diverse interests beyond medicine, things like computer science, chemistry, geography, art, engineering and the like. A lot of my hobbies used to be on these and other fields, I liked building stuff from wood, building electronic circuits, conducting experiments, building models of aircraft, going on bike tours in my free time. Especially the summer between graduating High School and joining medical school (medicine is an \"undergrad\" degree here but medical schools have more semesters than in the US) was awesome in this regard. I need to admit, I didn't really spend a lot of time doing these things but absolutely enjoyed it when I did.\n\nIt makes me sad to think about it, but I spent something like 70-90% of the free time (and unfortunately also a lot of time intended for studying) in my youth in front of a screen, doing absolutely nothing fulfilling but scrolling facebook, reddit or youtube and the like, or sometimes playing games. This would go on to become a major issue later as I joined medical school.\n\nThe curriculum is hard. The exams are nothing you just get handed for doing nothing. But looking back, they're not as bad as people like to make them out to be. But well, life throughout medical school had what it needed for making me seriously derailed. I seriously overestimated the difficulty of the exams, wanted to study night and day, have the best grades and best results in my whole class just like in High School and just live for my studies. Oh boy, that was not a healthy plan to follow.\n\nI remember quite vividly the times I sat in the uni canteen back in my second year in 2018, thinking to myself, 'I'm going to abandon my hobbies and desires to take up past hobbies again to keep things in my life simple and solely focus on my studies'. Well, surprise surprise, this just happens to be the mindset I acquired throughout High School where every grade mattered. Anyway, what followed was some kinda good-enough-ish-to-pass studying, no real leisure activities in my free time and CRAP LOADS of procrastination during studying times and times I wanted to spend doing fun things.\n\nI often sat in the library, unable to concentrate, lonely or desperate for human connection, wishing for something exciting to happen in my life, and feeling like I'm just uncontrollably wasting time.\n\nI look back upon the past years and see how I pointlessly wasted most of my time that I could have used for hobbies, studying, making and meeting friends, exercising and the like, all while trying to maxx out my studying (failing miserable at doing so) in combination with a lonely, unfulfilling life.\n\nWhen I think about the hard, overworked future, I get so filled up with regret over my wasted youth that I can't concentrate on just about anything, making me lose even more time and regretting that again and again.\n\nI completely burned out from this lifestyle back in summer semester 2020, when due to covid everything was online and I did the studywork of three semesters in the one semester. It only worked out because everything was online and I had literally nothing to do with all the time I had. But oh wonder, who could have thought that weeks upon weeks of hardcore studying without having a chance to meet your friends outside of whatsapp chats and phone calls can be deetrimental for your wellbeing?\n\nI've been living with my family since more than 1,5 years out of convenience and lack of a reason to stay in my uni town as all courses are online or finished. It alienated me from all the nice aspects of student life, my friend circles, the social life, facilities, etc whilst giving me more stress and anxiety. I love my family, but I just can't live with them anymore for long times and be productive all the while. Tried it often times in the past and was underwhelmed at best. My relationship with my family has seen better days. This has a lot to do with our values. Back in High School, the only thing that really mattered was that I have to get my High School diploma as good as possible and everything else may come later. I remember many times that I, the 16 year old boy that I was at the time, complained at home about not having a girlfriend. My family did understand my feelings and (successfully so back at that time) framed it as a good thing, a lack of distraction from my studies, which I bittersweetly appreciated and (again, successfully) made the best of it. That's the sort of innocence you only have as a child when you haven't had enough time to experience the fuckedupness of certain aspects of your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut anyway, the most productive thing I've been doing in the past year has been maintaining the computer systems of a new family business. Sometimes it was fun because I enjoy doing technology stuff since way back in school, but I rather did it out of feeling responsible since I am the most (somewhat) computer-skilled person in the family. The biggest reason though was that I did all the maintenance work as a way to cope with the dullness and loneliness of life in quarantine. It didn't feel like a hobby, or even like a normal job, but rather as a desperate escape out of the never ending studying, staying at home, having near zero privacy, feeling stressed, anxious, lonely, regretful and jealous routine. The times I truly enjoyed myself setting up the company server or improving the computers are rare and feel irrelevant compared to the times I did it out of duty or to distract myself from daunting thoughts and feelings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I sum all this up? It might sound cliche, but you need balance in your life. The way I lived since high school (to be honest, since way longer than that) just wears me down mentally and prevents me from studying or enjoying my life in any meaningful way. Corona quarantine made me finally realise that I just can't function this way. As trivial as it may sound, I need time for myself, for my privacy, for my friends and freedom of mind. Is it really my fault that I can't live happily whilst staying at home all the time or going to work? Surviving on the bare minimum and under living/working under pressure gets me nowhere and only fuels my pathologic procrastination habits (I had started to wonder whether I'm just disorganised or actually have undiagnosed adhd or a combination of both but psychiatrist appointments are hard to get, especially now with covid).\n\nMaybe someday my family will understand that surrounding myself with diversity, be it people, events or places I visit or whatever, and going out on Friday evenings doesn't distract me from studying but rather gives me a essential fraction of balance from the depressing life I'm living.\n\nDoes this sound like first world problems to a boomer who migrated, studied in their 30s and worked 8 night shifts per month while doing so? Maybe. Does it make a difference for me? No, because I saved up enough cash to sustain myself until graduation and am not a kid anymore. I'm soon 23 and don't want to be told how or where I have to do X or live my life. I never really dared un-shutting my mouth about the way I feel about my life because of fear of getting cancelled as an ungrateful, lazy manchild but now that I've got a good enough financial security I just don't give a damn, it is my life and I don't want to become a 40-something dude who looks back on his youth and can only remember the things he never dared to do. Thank god state universities aren't batshit expensive and our housing administration is chill about students signing their own dorm room rent contracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do all my problems stem from? Oh well, if it was simple to answer this question... I don't want to point a finger at something or someone without severe evidence and can only guess. Does it really matter? Probably, but I don't want to dive even further into that sort of stuff. All I want right now is to move out, sort out my life and my issues on my own, use the following three and a half years till graduation for my national final exams, the USMLE (having that one is regarded very highly in my country and can be a significant bonus if I decide to take a higher position sometime later in my career shall the wish come up), a scientific project and the final rotations year. Most important of all, I really just want to live my life on my own terms. Even if it may sound so, I don't want to burn down bridges to my old hometown and family, quite on the contrary. I want to improve my relationship with my family and I want to live like the adult I'm told I am and live a self-responsible life. And that just includes way more stuff than I have going for myself right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeck, I guess I lost my own thread. Sorry if it reads like an unorganised mess, but these are my thoughts that I mostly kept to myself over the past 1,5 years because I had very few opportunities to see my friends who are relaxed about talking this kind of stuff without serious judging and who knows, maybe someone can relate. Kudos to everyone who made it through my whole text. I wish you a bright future and a happy life.",

        "title": "Mouthbreather's \"\"\"Guide\"\"\" on matching Diagnostic Radiology",
        "post": "I\u2019m an MS4 that fully matched DR this year. I had 21 interviews for DR and matched my top 3 for both DR and intern year. I wanted to share some of my thoughts/reflections/things I wish I knew applying into diagnostic radiology this past cycle. There have been writeups in the past but in the era of virtual interviews, mass applying, and record application numbers, I thought I\u2019d talk a little about how I think the application landscape is changing for radiology and my lowly n=1 opinions on how rads hopefuls can prepare themselves. This is colored mostly by personal experience so obviously take it all with a tablespoon of salt. Everyone\u2019s story is different, I\u2019m just sharing what I learned from my journey.\n\nThis year, there were 0 unfilled spots for DR and 2 for IR (those spots were programs that didn\u2019t participate in the main NRMP match cycle, and one nucs med spot that\u2019s being internally filled). For reference, the only other specialties that also filled completely were ortho and Plastics. Neurosurgery, ENT, and Derm all had unfilled spots. This isn\u2019t to suggest that DR is now more competitive than those fields (it\u2019s not, those fields are still far more self selecting and you don\u2019t need to be proficient in softball to match) but just emphasizes how cutthroat the field has gotten in the past couple of years.\n\nDisclaimers: I\u2019m writing from the perspective of a (low tier) USMD. If you\u2019re a DO or IMG, you can probably learn stuff from this info as well but truthfully I\u2019m not fully familiar with all the extra hurdles DOs and IMGs go through to match DR and I don\u2019t want to espouse misleading information for you guys. Connecting with matched DO\u2019s and IMG\u2019s on the discord or spreadsheet will be in your best interest.\nAlso, I only applied DR. The broad strokes advice may still apply here but IR is pretty different in terms of your application and approach so if you\u2019re gunning for integrated IR/DR you may not glean much from this.\n\n--------------------------------**Application Foundations**--------------------------------\n\n**School Rank:** \n\tYea no shit this matters. In general USMD >> DO >>>> IMG except for a couple programs that are IMG heavy (Mercy catholic, Yale bridgeport as examples) No, this isn\u2019t Yale\u2019s main program you prestige whore\n\tIf you\u2019re at a T20 why are you reading this. You\u2019ll match by virtue of existing. Go outside.\n\t\nDOs and IMGs really struggled with the match this year and it will not get better. If you\u2019re a premed reading this and choosing a school and you\u2019re at all interested in DR or any other competitive specialty then attending an MD school with an attached academic center/home program is your best bet.\n\n**Step 2**\n\nWith step 1 now P/F this will be the big number programs use I think. My general benchmark estimates:\n\n*Sub 240*- would consider this to be a genuine weakness/borderline red flag in your app, I\u2019d make the effort to compensate in other areas of your application\n\n*240*- will probably put you among the weaker end of radiology applicants, but not unworkable\n\n*250*- baseline goal you should shoot for, basically the average range of matched applicants\n\n*260*- a great score, theoretically makes you competitive for any program in the country depending on the rest of your app \n\n*270*- \ud83e\udd13\n\nIf you fail step 2 or step 1, your app is dead in the water. \n\nI\u2019m gonna get like 50 comments saying shit like \u201cwell I know xyz student who matched UCSF rads with a 196!!!\u201d yea well as you can see by the length of this post scores aren\u2019t everything. Anyone can match with anything theoretically. But these score benchmarks at least let you get an idea of your competitiveness relative to the rest of the pack, which is important for building the rest of your app.\n\tBottom line: P/250 should be ok as a USMD. P/260 is ideal tho. DO\u2019s should shoot for P/260 as a baseline I think.\n\nDO\u2019s- take both steps. Yes, even though step 1 is P/F. This is non negotiable. Programs do not give a single shit about COMLEX even if their site says they accept it. \n\n**Clinical Grades**\n\t\nDon\u2019t need perfect grades, but honor as many as you can. Do whatever is necessary outside of academic dishonesty. Practice your head game. This isn\u2019t a guide on how to honor rotations, those exist elsewhere. Honors in big rotations (IM, surgery) mean more than smaller ones. How much Honors vs HP vs P impacts you depends on your school\u2019s grade breakdown. If you\u2019re High passing when 45% of your class is honoring that\u2019s less than ideal. If only 5% of your class honors then HP is fine. If you\u2019re Passing and your school is P/F then you\u2019re chilling. DON\u2019T FAIL A CLERKSHIP. You probably will not match. If your school publishes shelf grades in your MSPE, don\u2019t fumble those. Avoid shitty MSPE comments and try to get those scrubbed from your record.\n\n**Preclinical Grades**\n\nDon\u2019t matter as much as clinical grades, especially if they don't factor into AOA. Doing well in preclinicals doesn\u2019t hurt though, and being bottom quintile certainly won\u2019t help. Don\u2019t fail anything. Probably not as big of a deal as failing clerkships but you don\u2019t want any red flags in your app no matter how small. \n\n\n\n\n**AOA**\n\nNice to have. I was AOA and had several programs comment on it. If you\u2019re squinting for patterns mostly community programs and lower tier academics actively mentioned it (\u201cCongrats on AOA\u201d or \u201cI see you\u2019re academically strong, since you\u2019re AOA\u201d and comments of that ilk were what I heard). The big name programs I interviewed at did not mention it, so not sure if they care.\n\tIf you\u2019re gonna rant about how AOA is a diversity award/popularity contest go soapbox somewhere else. You definitely do NOT need AOA to match radiology (the vast majority of people that match don\u2019t, I was the only rads match from my school in AOA). I\u2019m just commenting on my thoughts on how much it impacts your app, not making a political statement. \n\n**GHHS**\n\nNo one gave a shit. This is a mickey mouse award\n\n**Research**\n\nDo something. This isn\u2019t ortho, you don\u2019t need 20 first author papers in the field. But do something. Does not have to be rads related, unless you\u2019re gunning to match Stanford/UCSF/MGH/NYU or the like. For reference, I had several pubs/presentations/posters in non rads fields that were based on interesting clinical/translational studies. I also had 2 first author radiology case reports. Every interviewer asked about the clinical projects. No one mentioned the case reports. Obviously rads clinical research would be the ideal, but the point here is to not only demonstrate academic productivity, but to have something interesting/memorable to talk about in interviews. 20 case reports isn\u2019t a conversation starter. Original research, even in another field, is a conversation starter. Original rads research is harder to do as students generally can\u2019t read scans which is a big part of most studies but if you can swing it it\u2019s awesome.\n\nCan\u2019t comment for sure on numbers, NRMP says like 8 total items which sounds about right. I\u2019d try to do like 1-2 clinical research projects (in any field, no need to be super anal about radiology)  and then fill the rest with case reports. ACR case in point is a good place to pump those out if you have a good mentor (RIP RSNA case reports). Radiology Case Reports has a publishing fee but turnover time is like 1 week so you can really go hard in that journal if your department pays for it. \n\nFormer surgical subspecialty switchouts/dual apps, you\u2019ll be okay (I was one of those) Radiology accepts people like you all the time, including residents that match these fields then regret it. I wanted to do a surgical subspec before rads and had a decent body of research in that field. Bonus points if that ENT work you did looked at imaging, It\u2019s an easy pivot on interviews!\n\tLike I said before, this isn\u2019t ortho. Research productivity doesn\u2019t compensate for poor grades and scores, and you can\u2019t kill an away like you could in surgical subspecs. So make sure your raw grades/scores are good as they build the foundation of your app. Good grades/scores with low research >> great research with shitty grades/scores.\n\nBonus: If any research work you did involved coding, statistical programming, or machine learning, try to swing it as a budding interest in AI. Many programs, especially academic ones, get their dicks hard the minute someone mentions AI/deep learning models.\n\n**Conferences:**\n\tUnfortunately, networking is becoming more of a thing in radiology as is the fate of any competitive field in a world of less objective metrics. If you can present at RSNA or ACR or SIR or any other conference, absolutely take the opportunity. Introduce yourself to as many PD\u2019s and APD\u2019s as possible, plant the idea of your existence as a seed into their subconscious. If you have nothing to present, I don't know how much value these conferences would have though unless you're a rizz god or somethng. I can\u2019t comment on this too much because I did literally none of this but if your above application metrics are weak then I\u2019d highly recommend doing this. As a terminally online introvert with the personality of a cement block I think networking is cringe but you gotta play the game. IMGs/DOs should especially be trying to do this. \n\n**Extracurriculars/Work Experience**\n\nNo one really cares about interest groups. No one cares if you worked in the student clinic. Programs do care if you did an interesting service/leadership activity. I had one cool service activity I did in preclinicals that got brought up in every interview (wasn\u2019t rads related at all). Make sure you can speak well on what the activity entailed and how you personally contributed. \n\nNontrads with previous work experience, wear it like a badge of honor. It makes you more interesting as an applicant. I can\u2019t comment on it firsthand because I went straight through but anything that makes your story more than \u201cI was premed in college and now I\u2019m in medical school\u201d is gonna be a talking point on interviews.\n\n**--------------------------------Building your App--------------------------------**\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nIMO the best setup for this is 1 radiology letter and 2 nonradiology clinical letters. Assuming all you did was a rads rotation and little else, a radiology LOR is going to inherently be weak. Students don\u2019t do much besides shadow on rads rotations and everyone knows it, so what\u2019s it gonna say? \u201cOh student X sat there like a good little boy/girl and didn\u2019t fall asleep in the reading room please RTM them :)\u201d -yeah not the best letter pal. Your clinical letters on the other hand can actually speak to your ability as a medical student so they can be more impressive. The specialty doesn\u2019t matter too much, just make sure they can speak strongly on your ability as a future resident.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how to get a good rads letter, the best answer is to do research with a rads mentor. Then they can say that you\u2019re academically productive and worked well on projects which makes your letter nicer. If you do research with multiple rads mentors, that\u2019s the only instance in which I\u2019d get a second Rads letter. \n\nHow you set up your 4th year rotations should depend on what you need. If you aren\u2019t sure about getting a good nonrads letter, *do a Sub I, especially in IM or Surgery*- I really really recommend this as a great way to get a good letter or two. If you\u2019re a newer switch into the field do a rads rotation to get a letter. Honestly your rads letter is more of a checkbox at that point than anything else but having one at least confirms you\u2019re not blatantly backup applying. \n\nDual/backup appliers should get try to get one rads letter from a rotation. Also, make sure your other letters don\u2019t say how great of an orthopedic surgeon you\u2019re gonna be lol don\u2019t get snitched on by your own homies\n\n**Away Rotations**\n\nDing ding ding the big million dollar question. You probably scrolled to look for this. I am of the opinion that yes, you should do an away if you can. This is coming from someone who didn\u2019t do one. Now, they aren\u2019t mandatory like they are for surgical subspecialties, but you should try to fit one into your schedule if you can. With step 1 going pass fail and the increasing number of apps, programs are looking for more ways to separate applicants from the flock. Away rotations can be your key. Some general guidelines:\n\n**1. DO A ROTATION AT A PROGRAM YOU WOULD BE ALREADY BE COMPETITIVE AT**. Doing an away at a rotation at a program does not guarantee an interview. This may sound lame, but think about it- all you do on most DR aways is shadow, or maybe take an exam or present on a topic. That\u2019s nice but it tells a program nothing about how good you\u2019d actually be as a resident.This is why I made a big deal of being able to assess your relative competitiveness as an applicant. Use texas star and residency explorer to get a better idea of this- if you\u2019re in the upper 25% of matched applicants statistics then it\u2019s probably a good idea to do an away there. Don\u2019t rotate at UCSF or MGH if you\u2019re a DO or have below average stats- you\u2019re not gonna get an interview and you\u2019re gonna waste everyone\u2019s time. \n\n**2. Aways should not take precedence over important application building rotations.** If you need a non radiology letter and you\u2019re debating between doing an away vs doing a sub I in medicine, the answer is the sub I. A strong application with no aways > weaker app with an away IMO. Getting letters from aways is hard to say. Do it if you don\u2019t have a home program. Otherwise, it\u2019s probably more valuable to build a strong connection to your home program and get radiology letter(s) there. \n\n**3. If you\u2019re looking to match in an area that you have no educational/personal ties to, do an away there.** If you\u2019re from the midwest and want to match in NYC, do an away in NYC. If you\u2019re looking to match to california and aren\u2019t attending medical school there, do an away in Cali. Unless you\u2019re a superstar candidate you will probably see poor yields in areas outside of your med school/hometown area so an away can help boost yields. That being said, rule 1 takes precedence here.\n\n**4. I don\u2019t recommend getting LOR\u2019s from away programs.** The big exception here is if you don\u2019t have a home program, in which case then you should. It\u2019s just that these letters are probably gonna be mid at best and home rads letters where the PD/writer knew you for longer will probably be of better quality. Again, everyone is different-maybe you really really vibed with an away faculty and want a letter from them. If you are confident it\u2019ll be a really quality letter, then go for it. But don\u2019t strategize your app around getting letters from MGH or NYu or Stanford and thinking this is like surgical subspecs where you do aways at places for great letters- it\u2019s not.\n\nMake sure to apply early and broadly- it\u2019s first come first serve for most programs. If you haven\u2019t finished your app and submitting to programs already, you\u2019re probably running late. Oops, probably should probably have submitted this sooner. This is what League of Legends does to you folks. Try to do research and ask around about what programs highly value away rotators. I have some leads but there are definitely many many others out there.\n\nNYC- Mt. Sinai Icahn SOM- great away experience, gave interviews to away rotators\n\nPA- Einstein Philly- highly highly values away rotators/demonstrated interest in the program\n\nCA- Santa Barbara Cottage- gave interviews to away rotators, great \u201cfoothold\u201d program into CA\n\nCA- Cedars Sinai- another great \u201cfoothold\u201d program into CA\n\nShoutout to these programs for doing the exact opposite:\n\nWash U St. Louis- rejected an away rotator 3 weeks into the away (per name and shame)\n\nUMD- did not provide interviews to multiple away rotators\n\nFYI both programs I listed above are great places to train at, and programs are under no obligation to give interviews to away rotators, especially in DR. Just know if you rotate there that you should prepare for this possibility. \n\nPost-ERAS submission aways are probably still valuable especially early on in interview season. The only thing is that you won\u2019t be able to get LORs from those but I think LOR\u2019s from away rads programs are almost guaranteed to be mid at best so I\u2019d recommend not building your app around those unless you have no home program. \n\n**Signals**\n\nThe other million dollar question. This year apparently applicants get 6 gold and 6 silver signals. I think the best thing to do with signals is just send them to where you wanna go. I have no clue why anyone would want a silver signal, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the headache of trying to mindgame which programs are getting silvers and which are getting golds. Send your golds to the ones you really like, and your silvers to the ones you also like but maybe not as much. Don\u2019t overthink it.\n\nMy only advice regarding signals is to NOT signal big name academic centers. UCSF, NYU, MGH, Upenn, etc do not put much weight into signals. They know everyone wants to train with them so they get their pick of the litter. Sending a signal to them is likely throwing your signal in the trash, especially if your application metrics aren\u2019t at or above their matched averages. I think you get the most bang for your buck from signaling smaller/mid tier academic centers and community programs. That being said, I\u2019m not your dad. Signal who you want. \n\nPS ask your home program if they want you to signal them. Some don\u2019t but others are dickheads and want one of your signals. Make sure you know. \n\n**Hobbies/Experiences**\n\nDamn i dont know what the fuck they\u2019re smoking at AAMC with this change but I guess I can talk about it. Sounds like common sense but talk about shit that\u2019s actually meaningful and you can talk freely and confidently/passionately about in interviews. Especially now since you have limited space. The student clinic you and 1000 med students volunteered at probably doesn\u2019t mean much. Oh, you led the student clinic? Well that\u2019s a lot better, you should talk about that. Activities where you took a leadership role are always gonna be more meaningful and interesting in interviews than stuff you were just a floater in. \nGonna copy and paste a comment I made a while ago about putting research as experiences in your ERAS. Applies to any specialty I think:\n\nPublications and \"experiences\" are different parts of your ERAS application, with Pubs having no cap. You can enter any publication as a \"research experience\" but you'll need to think a little harder about which ones you wanna put in.\n\nFor example, if you do a small filler case report and it gets published in a smaller journal, this is a publication and should be in your ERAS publication section. You could enter it as a research experience as well, where you describe the process you went through to get it written and published. However, this would not be a very meaningful experience and a waste of one of your ten entries.\n\nLet's say you lead a longitudinal translational research project in your field of interest that gets presented at a conference as an abstract, and then subsequently published in a large journal. Both the abstract and the pub will, again, go in your ERAS pubs section. However, this would also make a great research experience to use in your experiences tab. You could talk about how you led the project, the role you played in completing it, where it was presented, etc. This would make for a strong candidate in your experiences tab.\n\nTL;DR: Smaller filler projects are pubs but shouldn't be listed in experiences. Larger important projects should be publications and also listed as a research experience. Hope this makes sense.\n\nI would highly highly recommend including some space for hobbies in your eras. DR interviews are like 80% hobby talk, 10% why rads, 10% random shooting the shit. You don\u2019t need to have insanely interesting hobbies- even mundane stuff is great conversation food. I talked about TV (almost spoiled an interview on Better Call Saul's ending) and manga (Chainsaw Man my love) in some of my interviews. Just be sure you\u2019re genuine in those interests and can talk about them. Don\u2019t fabricate a hobby like underwater basket weaving to make yourself look cool because if you sound fake then that\u2019s gonna be an almost instant DNR. My home PD told me a story of a great applicant they DNR\u2019ed because he said he loved fly fishing in his hobbies section and our PD (who loves fly fishing) asked about it he couldn\u2019t talk anything about it. because it was made up. Yeah, don\u2019t do that.\n\nProbably 2-3 hobbies and elaborate a little on each. Don\u2019t just say running- were you on any competitive teams? Did you run a marathon/halfy/5k? Give some meat to it but not your whole life story. \n\n**Personal Statement**\n\nI feel very unconfident in talking about this part so I won\u2019t say too much. I was told my PS was good but no one really commented on it in interviews. I think the 10/80/10 rule applies here- 80% of PS\u2019s don't move the needle in any way, 10% are profound, 10% suck ass. You\u2019re not gonna be in that top 10% most likely so just try not to be in that bottom 10%. Spell check, and don\u2019t talk about how you wanna do rads because of lifestyle or because you \u201cLike PUZZLES\u201d -it\u2019s generic as fuck. Have as many eyes on it as possible- your mentors, your friends, your parents, your parole officer, Dealer Jim- get as much feedback on it as possible. Just make sure it doesn\u2019t suck or unintentionally reveal any personality disorders- that time you lit a live squirrel on fire and looking at the bones made you interested in Xrays is probably not a good radiology PS. \n\n\n**Conclusions/I skipped to the bottom** \n\nRads is getting pretty competitive. I\u2019d say it\u2019s not on the level of the surgical subspecs/derm but probably the most competitive one of the remaining ones. It\u2019s still not too bad if you\u2019ve built a decent app- I\u2019m not gonna hype it up like the psych and gas doomposters, but it\u2019s not a walk in the park like it was pre-COVID. Especially if you\u2019re a DO or IMG\u2026.\n\nMy spicy prediction we will see a small dip in application numbers this cycle- ChatGPT \u201cconcerns\u201d and people realizing it\u2019s not a safe backup may cause a small decrease in app numbers- but the process is becoming more opaque with tiered signals and more importantly P/F step 1.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n-GET GOOD STEP 2 SCORE. 250+ goal, 260+ ideal if you want to feel safer but I don't think there's really a safe score nowadays\n\n-GOOD GRADES IN MEDICAL SCHOOL- honors and HP\u2019s, don\u2019t low pass. DON\u2019T FAIL ANYTHING. Be top tertile/quintile/quartile/kitchentile or whatever your school does.\n\n-DO SOME RESEARCH- a couple case reports and a  independent project or two that you can talk about is your goal. Don\u2019t need 10+ pubs like an ENT manwhore but don\u2019t have nothing. \n\n-DO AN AWAY AT A TARGET RANGE PROGRAM. Know your competitiveness and choose your away intelligently. Don\u2019t ego it. Do it in a region you\u2019d potentially like to match in especially if you don\u2019t have prior ties. Again, not mandatory but it can really help.\n\n-BE A REAL PERSON- you\u2019re not a stat stick. Mention hobbies, ecs, prior jobs that you can talk about in interviews. The first 3 points get you the interview- it\u2019s these last two points that get you the match. \n\nI hope this helps a little. I wish I wrote this in march post match because then some of this advice would have been more timely like the aways but what can you do. \n\nI might do a part 2 on interviews and rank lists and what I think you should look for in a program so let me know if that's something you might be interested in. I feel like those are later cycle questions and wouldn't be super relevant right now. Plus I've already procrastinated on writing this up when I said I would so I try to write that this shit is never gonna get done. \n\nOther matched rads people feel free to chime in/correct me/share your experiences. I don't claim to be a know it all for this process by any means I still wonder how I managed to pull the devious heist on the program that matched me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to take DM\u2019s if you have more specific/personal questions but no butthole pics please.",

        "post": "US medstudent. In summary, I failed because of mental illness and health issues. I got severe GAD and PTSD, and \nmy therapist has actually been concerned for me and even asked me if I ever considered quitting medschool because the high stress has been triggering me. My mental health got so bad at one point that I got sent to the ER for psych eval. I couldn't go to school and was unable to study for days at one point due to this. It pushed me back so badly. This term was just full of many difficult family situations and mental health issues for me. It wasn't bad studying habits, procrastination, etc that led to my failure. \n\n\nI withdrew this term and I have the option to request to repeat the year. I love medicine and it took me SO MUCH hard work and years to get here.  Obviously, I'd love to stay because I love my school, however, I acknowledge that I'm pretty neurodivergent. Due to my mental illneses,  it takes me twice more energy than most people to function. I'm taking many meds to just be a \"normal\" person every day. \n\n\nmy family members have asked if I consider maybe quitting medschool and go to another medical field that's \"easier\"..\n\nHonestly, I'd love to be a doctor more than anything else, but I know how my path is extremely hard and I'd have to do 4 more years plus residency, which would be like 7-8 years of grind.. I know, I came in here expecting all this, but I didn't know my mental illness was this bad until school. \n\nShould I stay? Should I leave? The closest thing to being a doctor, I believe would be PA.. It's not what I want to get into and I would 100% choose to be a doctor (not into being a mid level practitioner), but schooling isn't as crazy rigorous as a MD/DO program and I'd still be able to be in the medical field and have some scope of practice similar to doctors.  Is it worth it. \n\nWhat would you guys do? Any advice is appreciated.",

        "post": "Hello!, mind my intrusion, If I could have just minutes of your time, that would really mean the world to me. I have something to ask about\u2026or rather, a short story to tell and needed guidance to apply. \n\nI\u2019m barely MS2 from NON-US school. In my school, the pre-med is taking only one semester. In this one semester, I managed to ace every course with ease, even cramming was brilliantly working for me. The rest wasn\u2019t making me happy or even worthy of such a Major. \n\nI am/was a chronic procrastinator all my life. Since high-school, I wouldn\u2019t study except to escape my parents\u2019 (Physical/Verbal)punishment. I grew up and the punishments were no more, I slacked a lot, having ton of materials to study A DAY or TWO before the exam, I dreaded studying but I had to. I kept getting very high grades but never did I feel worthy of those. \n\nIronically, from MS1-S2 to MS2-S1, I started getting the grades that -at the time- I felt worthy for, Bs/Cs, barely passing. It has really taken a toll on me, my mental health keep deteriorating by the day, my food routine is the worst of all time especially since I\u2019m living by myself, I\u2019m miles from being in shape, all is left is my physical health\u2026.I\u2019m thankful it\u2019s still there. It\u2019s that **inherent unworthiness** keeping their murmurs in my ears. **Falling in \u201ccramming abyss\u201d over and over**, seeing my friends really act responsibly and really recall the information even after months, where **I can't even start**, even if I started, **I would be distracted,** even if I pull through it, I would forget the next hour what I read. Having to remind myself \u201cIf I escape this\u201d I would hold patient\u2019s life with shattered framework, how would I act then?\n\n I did know, the outcome would be something of this sort, I even reminded myself when I get accepted of this unworthy, foolishly believing it to be rational decision. It\u2019s like surrendering before even trying to wage a war.\n\nUnpleasant feeling to have, really. To feel like hope is none anymore and trying is futile, because after every trying, ultimately, procrastination would take control, humble grades would come out, parents disappointment and anger is inevitable. My memory or short focus span or pain endurance don\u2019t make it any better, either. \n\nThere were few instances where I didn't procrastinate, didn't slack. I did understand a fragmented beauty of Path or Biochem. Those were long before this day, sadly.\n\nI have a midterm of musculoskeletal system in less than 16 hours! This mid worths 40%, the final worths 60%, the minimum passing is 50%, I think there is a chance to pass, but the inevitability of my past attempts, to compensate lower my spirit, keep reminding me of how worthless and piece of shit I'm and as if there isn't any light ahead of me. \n\nFinally, I'm sorry mother, I'm sorry that I had broken yet another one of my promises, haha just how would it be if another sperm were to succeed instead of me, I'm sure as hell, he would made you prouder, I'm really sorry.\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m a chronic procrastinator that his own incompetent self had caused him to waste his 1.5MS years, ultimately making him drown in various mental issues of self-loathing, unworthiness, pessimism (etc), having major confusion of why and how I\u2019m such a bastard and wondering if there even a solution\u2026",

        "post": "I\u2019m at a USMD and my mental health has been progressively declining. I\u2019ve been dealing with mental health issues for a few years now, but it hasn\u2019t affected my academic life like this before. I just kind of stopped going to class and doing my lectures. I usually just sleep/lie down in bed for most of the day because I just don\u2019t have any motivation to do anything. I walked into exams having only watched like 10% of the lectures. For the past few exams,  I literally just studied like the 8-10 hours pre exam, which usually also involves all-nighters, and I walk into the exam room not knowing anything about that block. As a result, I have two classes I need to remediate. Admin also found out about my mental health issues - they saw my grades plummet and literally brought me into the deans office bc I was doing well before and came in with a high MCAT score and they figured something must be going on for me to fail. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do with myself anymore. Every night before I fall asleep, I tell myself that I will wake up the next morning and be productive. When I wake up, I keep telling myself \u201cjust 10 more minutes\u201d and end up  procrastinating the entire day. I understand I\u2019m not functional due to my depression and the school wants me to go on leave, but I actually think that will make my circumstances worse. All I want right now is to be a functional student again, but I just don\u2019t know how to achieve this. I\u2019d really appreciate any advice + strategies from folks who have been in similar situations. \n\nI also wanted to ask about my chances of matching into a competitive specialty or a top program (of a less competitive specialty) with my preclinical remediation record. Would this be something I can overcome with a high step 2 score? I\u2019ve traditionally done well on standardized exams and I\u2019m pretty confident in doing well if I can just get my shit together hahaha but I guess that\u2019s the main problem. \n\nWould love to get any advice or suggestions to improve my situation that doesn\u2019t involve going on LOA and find out the realistic potential of matching well. Thanks y\u2019all!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m already on meds + seeing a therapist multiple times a week. Not much more to do on that end. Also I\u2019m pretty sure this would make me more suicidal (don\u2019t shit on me for this lol but I\u2019d rather drop out than go on leave). ",

        "title": "I have ADHD.",
        "post": "I didn't study before medical school, not really. I got home from high school every day and played Minecraft until 1 am and then slept in biology. I graduated 7th in my class of 900 with very little effort. Even on important things like the ACT, I very rarely spent more than a few minutes every now and then focusing on studying because I knew that I'd be fine. When I tried to study I would always inevitably be distracted by whatever-the-fuck. There's was always something I could find to do instead of the thing that I wanted to do, whether that be Minecraft, texting, YouTube, whatever it maybe. Even when I wanted to study, I couldn't. I thought this was normal. I underachieved upward into a very good undergraduate college. My mom did most of my applications, and I wrote the application essay the night before the last possible submission date.\n\nIn college I was the same way, except I didn't do as well because the content was harder (obviously). I only ever studied a day or two before exams. The only motivator that could convince me to really do anything was the threat of an exam. Even for things that I enjoyed and cared about, I was constantly finding myself distracted by YouTube, or a movie, or my phone, or music, or my roommates conversation, or humming the song I heard yesterday. I don't really know how to describe the feeling of wanting to study but not being able to convince yourself to start.  Junior and senior year of college were very difficult for me because most of my classes were higher level classes that took a lot of effort. I never had a consistent study routine of any sort and I didn't do nearly as well as I know I was capable of. I studied seriously for the MCAT for about a week until the schedule I attempted broke down and I ended up playing Minecraft and occasionally reviewing. It might go without saying but I am a chronic procrastinator, as I rarely start doing things that I need to do until the last possible minute. Anything without a deadline never gets done. I graduated college, and a week later I was homeless because I had been procrastinating apartment applications until literally the moment I was moving out of my house and into a storage locker. I wrote most of my medical school applications in a coffee shop while being homeless as a result of my own procrastination. \n\nBeing homeless was a wakeup call of sorts. I realized that the inability to focus is not something other people struggle with. During my gap year I finally convinced myself to make an appointment with a mental health service (after 3 months of procrastination). The NP that works there prescribed me Adderall after a brief questionnaire. The first time I took Adderall was nothing short of revelatory. For the first time I could engage with activities and do them without the constant urge to have 3 things going at once. Again, I don't really know how to describe the difference. Suddenly I wasn't letting the dishes pile up, I could clean my house regularly, my screen time went down by literal hours, hell, I even cleaned my car. Slowly the tolerance built up, as it does, and we slowly increased my dose. \n\nI got to medical school and the Adderall was doing its thing and for most of the first semester I was living the dream. There were occasionally days where the focus was a little off, but for the most part I felt that I was finally performing to my best capacity. I made appointments, I paid bills, I even made a budget. The one problem was the cost of the place I was going was pretty high. The Adderall itself was covered by my insurance but the visits themselves weren't. Also I became frustrated with how depersonalized our interactions were, most visits were How's it going? Bad? Ok we'll up the dose. I did not feel like I was dealing with an expert in their field and moreso just a guy who wanted my money in exchange for the drug that lets me study. \n\nBecause of this I pursued other options at our student counseling center because it was advertised to us as being free. Over the course of the first semester I was tested for ADHD by several people at the counseling center. The psychometrist that I met with after the testing told me that the results were clear-cut ADHD-haver. Great. I schedule an appointment with the psychiatrist. \n\nToday I finally got to meet the psychiatrist and after an hour of conversation, 20 minutes of which was family history, she tells me she believes I have an adjustment disorder. I have never felt my heart sink quite like it did as I realized that the psychiatrist sitting in front of me believes I do not have ADHD. I don't know if I failed to adequately portray my symptoms, or if the testing magically changed its requirements for ADHD, or something got lost in translation between the 5 people I saw before her. I was in denial about my ADHD for years, to the detriment of every part of my life, from school to work to my housing. I sought treatment, and for a long time it worked and brought my attention abilities up to a reasonable standard. I was dissatisfied with my care so I reached out to the support system that our school has offered to us, and after months of back and forth with midlevels, I finally get to see a doctor and I am told I have an adjustment disorder. I don't remember the last time I was this upset and I genuinely can't describe how frustrating this experience has been. I did everything right. I checked all the boxes, I did the testing, I spoke with the NP and the psychometrics guy and the DNP and all the people I had to meet with before this MD and I get here and my symptoms are being dismissed as adjustment disorder. I don't really feel the need to defend my ADHD-having or my lack of an adjustment disorder to a bunch of strangers, but I have had ADHD symptoms my entire life and nothing has changed. I don't feel that I am under any more stress in medical school than I was in undergrad (I actually generally feel less stressed), and I am genuinely astonished that this is the interpretation of my symptoms that I was presented with today. In the moment I was in such shock that I didn't even push back. I froze, and now I have an appointment with a psychologist for therapy. Every analysis I've seen has said that therapy is not an effective treatment for ADHD, but I'm going to go anyway. \n\nI ran out of Adderall a week ago and I've been falling behind in class since then. Even before then my tolerance was so high it was like I wasn't taking it. I can barely get through my reviews every day without a youtube video going, I've gone through two rewatches of Bojack in the last month. I've already made an appointment with the old NP but now I feel like I'm doing something shady instead of getting the healthcare I need. It's so weird and I'm having so many emotions right now. If you made it this far thanks for reading. ",

But honestly it\u2019s because I have to study significantly less then others. I guess I simply don\u2019t need to revise the information so much for it to stick. \n\nI also get good evaluations on my clinical rotations. So it appears from the outside that I\u2019m doing great but everything is such a struggle and I don\u2019t know if I can take it anymore. \n\nI just can\u2019t study, I can\u2019t stop procrastinating and just sit down and focus on my work. Everyday I tell myself that today I will study and then end up doing nothing. It has been like this from the start. It might seem crazy but I don\u2019t really care about that I have good results, I just want to be proud of myself for the effort I put in.\n\nI have a lot of executive dysfunction and it affects me so bad. This semester I\u2019m writing my bachelor thesis (it\u2019s required in med school in my country). It has really put my weaknesses to test and I\u2019m probably gonna fail because it\u2019s so hard for me. Not the subject or work really, but just DOING IT. \n\nI just feel lazy and hopeless and my daily struggles is destroying my mental health. I don\u2019t know if med school is worth struggling like this. And the worst part is that it\u2019s my executive dysfunction that is the problem, not that it\u2019s hard or boring. I love medicine. But I\u2019m so sick of my life being like this.",

        "title": "I just want to vent about an a-hole pharm guy I interacted with today",
        "post": " \n\nI just need to vent everything today, cuz f-it. I was okay with grades before medical school, honestly, I could knock out all the material the night before and still easily get an A in the class. That was my experience in high school, undergrad save for the initial stumble in freshman year of uni. When I started medical school, I couldn't focus on the material and didn't think much about it, after all, I could study the night before and be okay, and that had worked till now, right? Big mistake and hella unhealthy I know, and low and behold, I failed the first block, by like 3-5qs of a 100(. school is total pass fail)\n\nI initially thought only 5 questions and I could have made it and then I had to remediate this exam. I tried hella hard to focus again and couldn't change it. I had always thought that it was just bad procrastination and I will get over it, but nah this cycle has continued till now. So after 8 blocks of medical school, I am about to start for step. In the middle I had to remediate again and was on the cusp of having to redo the year and long story short, despite the immense anxiety and almost breakdown about the shame and all the things that would happen should I have to redo a year, I could change. It was almost as if the exam needed to be very close for my mind to even register the stress and finally start the studies. Hell, even when studying the 2 days before the exam when I start studying material for the first pass, I still find ways to waste time, for example I watch anime or play chess, thinking it will only take a couple minutes or a short rest and it turns into 2 hour long break.\n\nThis causes me to miss time and in the given time, only way I could finish the lectures is by 2xing every single one( my school has video recording of live/non live lectures for review, so no need to go to class) even then I have to miss some lectures I deem them less high yield and don't finish. So after barely passing all my blocks and remediations ( although in remediations I do above average but still, a remediation, and also studying pattern remains same) I finally decided that I am not normal, a pretty hard condition to accept considering I am eldest and come from a Indian background+ the general stigma( mental health is a big no no, also just Fyi, I do want to be a doctor personally, no pressure there but just they don't think I can have a mental health condition).\n\nAnyways, with the final block in front of me, I decided to finally see a specialist. I was told that to go through the school, it would be at least 3 months before I see them because of the backlog. PP would be fast but still really long time, and I needed to start step studies fast( take it in April, and I haven't studied shit so far). Enter Talkiatry- it is an online psych consult with a psych guy through telehealth and was within 2 weeks of booking the appointment. So I did and the doc said I do have all the symptoms of ADHD since outside of school I also have such behaviour in other things( paying bills, credit cards late despite having money etc). Doc said find a pharm that has adhd drugs in stock and then send him the info, which I did and I got a medication Concerta 36 mg today. Everything good so far.\n\nSo I go to pick my med and they say that its going to take them 20 mins more, which is fine. I guess they thought I was gone and not sitting in the waiting area of the CVS. I can loudly hear the pharmacist( not a tech but the pharmacist) talking his coworkers about me. He goes so \"Concerta huh? You know what I think people need, attention, not meds but attention. How bad is this situation that these people come to get the meds and cause this shortage and take it away from people who really need it. Just cuz they cant focus, you need attention and not abusing these meds. I hear a pharm tech say something, not clear, but in response, this guy still loud af says, \"Just  Like that guy who was here,  his doctor is in texas, etc.\" At this point, I haven't met this guy or talked to him in my life cuz the pharm techs help you check out most of the time. I just wanted to get mad at this guy since, what gave him the right to judge me? Did I break any rules? Or do I abuse the meds I have never even tried in my life? Like it's not like I woke up one day and said \"ah CNS stimulants, that's what I want to eat like candies!\" I wanted to confront him so much, but it took lot of restraint to not.\n\nOnly when I went to pick up when my med was ready did I calmly tell him that not all people who use telehealth are abuser, you turd(turd part was in my head). He tried to defend by saying he didn't mean me but that was a bald faced lie.\n\n F him and his team at the CVS.... Vent over and if you've read so far thank you and really very sorry for it to be so long. I wanted to just write about this but then it just ballooned into this massive post. This just feels so good to just get it out in the world, and still have my identity not questioned.",

        "post": "**Preclinical**\n\n* Reduce preclinical years to 1-1.5 years.\n* Hire 3-5 dedicated *actually trained and certified* teachers. One surgery or radiology doc for anatomy and related topics, one research/pathology focused for basic sciences and histology, and one generalist (med-peds or ED) for the rest.\n* Sketchy and UFAP are paid for and officially part of the curriculum.\n* Dedicated research educators. At least 1 bench, 1 clinical, and 1 literature reviewer. Each takes on X# of students each year. Clear authorship tables required. Don't like direct research? Do a lit review. They're not allowed to give more than 1 lecture though, bc it'd be super boring. Seriously guys, knowing research is one of the few things that separates us from mid-levels.\n* 2 mental health counselors with opt out appointments: 1 with CBT and secondary trauma focus, 1 with ACT and anxiety focus. Both with procrastination and study skill training.\n* Seriously 2 logistical staff max. LCME needs to hire a few high quality C.S. people to create organizers and schedulers for everyone, to stop all this inefficiency.\n* Every staff, esp. the deans, state their responsibilities. LCME will have a list of measurable required ones. Student feedback of each teacher and administrator will be used by the LCME.\n* 8 hours/week max of mandatory lectures. One 8 hour day/week of clinical activities (OSCE's, clinical sites, etc). 8 hours/week max for the rest (anatomy, important but not tested content like social issues)\n\n**Clinical**\n\n* Start clinical years earlier.\n* I think the clerkship director system is good, just needs improvements.\n* Hard limits on clinical hours, 30 hrs/week. 10 hrs/wk for education. Shelf review required.\n* 6 weeks max on any core rotation (looking at you surgery).\n* Now we can justify hard sub-internships and away rotations. This is where we do nights and learn what bad hours are (Are you happy now surgery/OB?). This only works if we start clinical years earlier, bc there's time to switch specialties if we learn we hate it.\n* LCME (med students) and ACGME (residents) review attendings for rounding efficiency. 2 hours max. If extra time is needed, attendings should work with the resident 1 on 1.\n* Limit retracting in surgery to 1 hour for students.\n* 1 brief 10 minute lecture per day for clinical algorithms.\n\n**Electives**\n\n* Completely redo this. The extra 0.5-1 year taken from preclinical goes here. The savings on preclinical salary can pay for better teachers in these areas. Schools can use their undergrads or work together to split costs.\n* Model it after college: X weeks of humanities, inter-disciplinary, tracks, and core electives (aways, Sub-I's, etc.)\n* Humanities: Trauma support, advanced ethnicity and culture, gender, compassion and resiliency courses (and no more b.s. wellness classes!), all that cool stuff.\n* Inter-disciplinary: dietician (under-rated for my medicine peeps), physical therapy (under-rated for my surgical peeps), social work, etc.\n* Tracks: the same ones we know and love. Leave a month for track based electives. Just bc I don't want to do 3-4 years of a track, doesn't mean I don't want to learn about administration or business. Plus this can be a research month. And we can stop the scheduling nightmare for students who need extra time off for their track.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Shorten pre-clinical time and reduce salary waste, use the LCME more for our advantage, limit clinical hours, use extra resources and energy to revamp electives and research.",

        "title": "[Preclinical] Advice please! I did not attend mandatory shadowing sessions, how do I talk to my course director about this",
        "post": "I need advice on how to approach this situation. Long post for context, TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n\nI'm currently an M2 at an MD school. One of the requirements of the clinical doctoring course is to schedule and attend several shadowing sessions with a physician you have been assigned to work with. I did not do these, and I am meeting with my course director about this next week. I'm seeking advice about how to explain the situation to her and best plead my case for an opportunity for remediation.\n\n\nWe had to do the same shadowing in M1, and I was assigned the same doctor to shadow this year. However, I did not have a good experience with this doctor, and I dreaded going into the office with her again. The thing is, there was nothing wrong with HER, she was a great doctor in a very specific subspecialty. But I was (at the risk of sounding petulant and entitled) kind of miserable shadowing with her. Basically it came down to not feeling like I was able to do anything hands on, and standing behind her for 4 hours while I heard great stories from my classmates about their clinical learning experiences.\n\n\nHaving been assigned to more shadowing sessions with her this year, I basically procrastinated on scheduling them with her since I dreaded them so much. Every other part of my education seemed more important, enjoyable, and... educational. The more I procrastinated on scheduling, the more irrationally anxious I became about \"bothering her\" so late in the semester. Eventually I did email my preceptor late in the semester about completing the sessions but she never responded to my email. It took me so much effort to grit my teeth and send that email, I was so defeated by her lack of response that I just ran out the time allotted to do these sessions. \n\n\nNow I'm meeting with the course director about why I haven't completed these sessions. Basically, part of this is due to my issues with my preceptor, but it could all be solved if I had requested a preceptor change early enough in the semester. Why didn't I do this? I'm not sure. I think it's partly because of a specific anxiety I have of offending or bothering people who are my professional seniors. I didn't want to say \"I am unsatisfied with my preceptor\" because that would be incredibly presumptuous of me. Of course my extreme avoidance of the situation was much much worse.\n\n\nI realize this has revealed an issue for me that may rise to the level of a legitimate mental health problem. I've had this \"social anxiety with contacting people in positions of seniority over me\" before with teachers and mentors, but it's caused problems in the past, but never to this extreme degree.\n\n\nI'm meeting with the course director next week to ask her to let me remediate the sessions. If I can't, I imagine this will be a fail in the course and I don't know if I should be worried about dismissal or something like that at this point. I do know you have the chance to remediate failed exams. But the syllabus is unclear as to how missing mandatory but ungraded sessions is managed in terms of remediation. Additionally, I don't know if this is enough of a lapse of professionalism to bring the question of dismissal to bear.\n\n\nAt the end of it, how much of this whole internal struggle should I relay to course director when I meet with her and what would be the best way to approach asking her for a chance to remediate these sessions? Thank you for your help!\n\n\nAs a side note, I recognize I have a personal problem here and I am trying to get an appointment with mental health services to see if they can help me deal with these issues before they cause more problems for me.\n\n\nTL;DR - I didn't go to mandatory shadowing sessions I was supposed to because I dreaded them (for not very compelling reasons), and my weird social anxiety made me procrastinate on talking to my course director about it till it was too late. How do I explain the situation to my course director and ask her for an opportunity to remediate them?",

        "post": "Hi, I\u2019m in a 6 year medical school program and I\u2019m about to finish my first year. I know I shouldn\u2019t be thinking in this this soon but I have pretty clear I want to be a psychiatrist. \nSometimes I procrastinate about what I actually have to study, like histology or any subject just to keep reading on medical psychology or psychiatry . Next year I finally  have this subject and on 3 year I will take psychiatry . When I do this I will finally know if I really want to specialise in this field or not. \n\nI know it\u2019s a very hard field and I think psychiatrist salaries are on the lower percentile within the medical fields , I know most of the time we don\u2019t get to \u201ccure\u201d a patient and I\u2019m aware I might only want to do this because I struggle with mental health and illness myself a lot but at the same time I think that\u2019s the exact reason why I would be good there. \n\nNow my question is ... is it a dying field? Are psychiatrists on demand or considered essential? And most of all, research. I still don\u2019t know how psychiatric research work or if there is any of it overall. Wouldn\u2019t Research in this field be more appropriate to like neurologists and stuff like that (I apologise for any ignorant comment I make here) ? Because I\u2019m very interested in research .\n\nI would also like to know what else can a psychiatrist do aside of the traditional sitting on a desk talking to patients diagnosing them and giving them pills. Is there jobs for them outside of the \u201cmedical field?\u201d \n\nSorry for the poor English too.",

        "title": "[Update] So you failed Step 1 and so did I",
        "post": "Hi guys, it's been a while. I'm the student from last year that failed Step 1 by **one point**, original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/3f37cj/so_you_failed_step_1_and_so_did_i/). Well, it's once again Wednesday and we know what that means:  more scores. I'll cut straight to the chase. I passed. With a 250. [Proof here](http://imgur.com/pPMhQct). If anyone is curious, I made a slight modification to UFAP. I used UFAP and threw in SketchyMicro (seriously, please use this instead of trying to learn micro from FA) and a healthy amount of Brosencephalon's Anki decks. Should I ever happen upon Brosencephalon in real life, I will buy him at least 62 beers.  \n  \n  \nNow that I have a 1000lb. weight off of my shoulders and the depressing ass winter I spent huddled in my apartment over FA behind me, I wanted to make this update mainly for others that suffered my same fate:  failing Step 1. I promise, ***you are not alone and you will bounce back from this***. I wanted to give those struggling a short list of things I found that really helped me overcome the anxiety (and trust me, there was a surplus) and negative nancy feelings associated with squaring off against this beast for a second time.  \n  \n  \n1. I was going to save this one until the end but I feel it's too important to place down there:  **Talk to those you love/are close to and let them be your rock**. There will be times when you feel overcome with hopelessness and you question whether or not you can do this. I had plenty. Each time, the few friends I shared my secret with were there to keep my feet firmly planted on the ground. If they happen upon this thread, I hope they know that I can never fully repay them for the favors they did me, but I'll do my damndest to try. In fact, I started out my second attempt without telling a soul what I was going through. Read this carefully:  *do not do what I did*.  \n  \n  \n2. **Figure out where you went wrong**. I'm going to dip into the clich\u00e9 barrel and fish out a vastly overused yet uncannily applicable quote:  *Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results*. What did you do the first time that didn't help? Was it lack of effort or lack of understanding? Did you study alone or in a group? Did you take a course or rough it on your own? Did you get inside your own head or did you miss what the question was asking? This step was crucial for me. I was stuck thinking about questions from two blocks ago. I missed subtle hints and probably a fair amount of giveaway buzzwords, simply because my head was somewhere else. I identified my problem, worked on it, hammered it into oblivion, and then set out with a new study regimen (just in case). Figuring out what you need to change is paramount to your success this time around. If you hop back in the same vehicle without fixing your flat tire, you aren't going to get very far.  \n  \n  \n3. **Get help**. And I don't mean the study kind, though if you need it then seek it. I mean if you have thoughts on your mind that keep you from performing at your absolute 100%, *talk to someone*. I was on the verge of panic attacks and convincing myself that I had trained my whole life for med school only to fall short as a flaming wreck when it really mattered. This thought process is toxic, unneeded, unwanted, and most of all, unhelpful. I made use of my school's student health counselor and identified my issue and learned some self-soothing techniques. I know there's a huge stigma associated with seeking mental health help, but let me tell you, I wouldn't have moved very far past the starting line had I not gone in. All I needed was one sour thought and my heart would beat out of my chest, I would get an adrenaline rush, and I wouldn't be able to rid myself of thoughts of failure. I'm sharing this with you so that you can head this off at the pass. **Don't let your own pride keep you from seeking help**. I can't stress this one enough.  \n  \n  \n4. **Pull out all the stops**. Consider this the second half, the fourth quarter, the final period. Remove all distractions and strap yourself in for a hellacious ~4-8 weeks, depending on how much time you've allotted. I averaged 13-15 hours a day on my end. There can be no more nights off, no more taking it easy. I tell you this to save you from yourself. The mind is insanely talented at coming up with excuses as to why you should procrastinate. \"You've studied nine hours already, you should watch a movie.\" or \"You really killed it this morning and did well on all those blocks. You should take the evening off.\" Cut this thought process off now. I don't mean you literally have to kill yourself studying, but at no point during this tenure should you be satisfied with \"Well, that's good enough.\" You aren't only studying to pass, you're studying to prove a point. That you did not deserve to fail and that you are more than a low test grade.\n  \n  \n5. Most important of all, **Believe in yourself**. Even if you've lost all hope, remind yourself that you were indeed intelligent enough to make it into med school and you are indeed intelligent enough to overcome this obstacle. Your school and professors and peers place an enormous amount of emphasis on this test and that can lead to an enormous amount of pressure on you. Sometimes that can be crippling. At the end of the day, this test is no different than the other tests that you have taken before and done well on. You have ample time to study, you have ample time to prepare, *You will pass this exam and you will become a physician*. Anyone who leads you to believe otherwise should be kicked in the shin. Multiple times.  \n  \n  \nThat's all I have, guys and gals. I wish each of you the best of luck in all your endeavors. Should you need a friendly internet stranger to talk to, feel free to PM me. I'll check back in on this account from time to time. Go forth, kick Step's ass, and conquer.",

Can I make more time for family? I can\u2019t find answers to these questions and it just makes me sad some days. Why should being in med school mean that we have to be so lonely and not be able to meet and see people. In regular college at least I got to see people from my friend group most days and hang at least a couple days a week, but now I\u2019m lucky to even see someone more than once a week. At the same time I know I need to be studying more and improve my grades, but I\u2019m afraid that will just end up making me more lonely.",

So I made an account just to say thank you!\n\nI just got back my exam results for the most recent exam and got a satisfactory grade, meaning Im 99.999% sure to have passed the year. This is a particularly happy moment for me as I am repeating the year due to depression/money troubles/relationship issues/etc. \n\nBut yeah, thank you so much all you lovely people who post in here for the somewhat relevant procrastination.

I usually get As as a mark but I feel I do not deserve it cuz I don't work hard for it. The things that I can study in 3 hours takes from me 1-2 days, because I go do something else. What is the result? I didn't study nor was I able to enjoy the other thing, and it is very exhausting. I tried to reach the wellbeing center, but they called me now (start kf the holidays). I cancelled it, maybe because I want to enjoy the holidays better, maybe because I am avoiding it like I am doing with my studies. I do not know if I should call them again in holidays or just wait until school again. I just do not like the way as it is now\n\nSorry for the long post, I just want to wanted someone to listen.",

I passed first year but it was so much less work. Apparently 2nd year is supposed to be the hardest, and when they said it is a lot of work, they meant it.\n\nSo we are in the 4th or 5th week of teaching. Gone through most of GI anatomy as self-directed learning in one week, alongside loads of physiology. Barely managed to finish the prescribed work during that week (online lectures, in person classes, workbooks etc.) but there is no time for revising it! So here I am, weeks later, doing basically the same stuff every single week. I don't know how others in my class aren't as stressed as me. They do complain about the workload but they just focus on it, do a few hours a day and are good, in the meantime I feel that if I worked the same hours every day I would fail. I also don't know how they can stay so focused for hours at a time, I find it so easy to procrastinate and while the stress would usually help me not to do it that much, right now it is at a level where I can barely get myself to work without internally freaking out. Like my leg bouncing (something I always had but that is intensified right now), me just thinking all the time how the fuck I am going to remember all the stuff they are teaching us and me freaking out about shitty lectures from people who should not be in teaching, that are so useless I will have to repeat most of it at some point.\n\nI used to have anxiety/random panic attacks for a few months and I took medication for it. Got off the medication over the summer, and now I am thinking, what if it actually helped with other stuff and if it would have been better if I continued taking it. I mean, I've been overthinking things my entire life and how great would it be to have a therapist at the moment, but how am I going to afford this (let alone an extra 1-2 hours every week) to talk through it and it won't help now.\n\nAnd yes the workload is terrible but it would be manageable if I actually just managed to CHILL for a bit and organise myself. I just literally won't be chill as soon as I start studying and I don't know why. It wasn't like that last year, yeah it's more work now, but why the fuck can I at least not rely on myself being stable for a moment. I'm lowkey tempted to just take an Ativan so I can get my thoughts together for a bit and stop being so stressed but that's only going to provide short term relief and idk what I can do to literally just chill.\n\nSorry about my disorganised rant. Any advice welcome ofc, although I have no idea what kind of advice I'm looking for. I just need to get a grip, that's it.",

I was (and still am) dealing with some major changes in my life like a break-up, family issues, and friendship-fallouts so it was as much of a transition period as it could be. That being said, I passed my two blocks, but could have done a lot better (had a few close calls on exams, so I really had to buckle down for some of the latter ones in the semester). \n\nI reached out to my PCP about ADHD (I've been experiencing some symptoms for as long as I could remember but decided to power through since I could get by without addressing it) and he expressed his concern about me matching and being on documented meds + potential addiction and kind of never got back to me LOL. I think that some of my study habits and behaviors can definitely be refined, but I feel like my inability to sit down still, constant fidgeting, and inclination to get bursts of motivation late in exam prep is really detrimental (which leads me to procrastinate to avoid the stress via the gym, video games, etc.).\n\nI really want to be a top student who is on top of their shit, but I feel like I'm seriously getting in my own way. I can't help but think about STEP1 and how I need to have this squared away well before then. Does any one have any advice having experienced something similar? Thank you!",

        "post": "M1 year is quickly coming to a close and I still haven't figured out what I'm going to do with my summer. I will be living at home (I'm \"old\" and married, so home is with my spouse and pets) instead of near my school since once M2 starts I'll have to spend much more time away from home. For background info, I'm pretty strongly interested in DR/IR and my grades so far are excellent (sort of \"gunning\" for AOA since step 1 will be P/F for me... I must be blessed since I haven't had to work too incredibly hard to get good scores). I'm at a mid-low tier (I think) MD school.\n\nI would like to get into research but don't have any leads. I reached out to the PD of the orthopedics program in my hometown to see if any residents or faculty could use help with any projects. I have connections there since I scribed for several of the ortho surgeons before med school and formed good relationships with them, although the PD did not use our services so I've never personally met him. This was about a week and a half ago and I haven't heard back yet, which I figured was a very real possibility and I'm not offended. \n\nI guess I just don't know what to do next. I have no idea of any research projects that I would like to pursue myself since I'm pretty inexperienced in that area. There is no rads residency at the med school in my hometown, but there are in cities 1-2 hours away. Should I cold email PDs from these programs just to see if I get any bites? Should I contact PDs from other programs in my hometown? I'm happy to also just do some volunteering as there are plenty of opportunities for that around here. I know that research isn't a hard requirement for rads but ortho is probably my #2 at this point and I also want to be as strong of an applicant as possible for whatever field I choose. I can always contact faculty at my school but since I want to stick around home for the summer I don't know how much they can help me. \n\nHope I don't sound too neurotic here, lol. I am the opposite of that but it sometimes gets me into trouble, like when I put off things like this. I definitely plan on enjoying my summer but I don't want to regret not pushing harder to get into some research, ya know? Cheers.",

Ideally I'd like to buy something that lasts for a long time if I'm buying a new suit, so I'm leaning more towards SS since I've heard good reviews about them. The only two other suits I've gotten in my life were off-the-rack suits that were tailored like absolute garbage, so if I'm being honest, I'm looking to get something that actually looks good on me this time.\n\nAlso when's the latest time I can buy a suit and get a headshot before ERAS submission?

When I got accepted, I was thinking \"I've got this, gonna just study hard and get As.\" Boy was I wrong, sometimes I am even struggling just to pass. This is way harder than I gave anyone credit for and I now understand the memes of the alien dude wanting out of medical school, of course despite the difficulty I wouldn't give it up. I am currently in my first year and am excited for the third year to actually apply the theory. With that being said I now wonder if I will even be a good physician because of the struggle and the grades I am getting. It is a constant battle. Wow, medical school is hard. I am jealous of my peers who just get it and are scoring high As on all of their tests meanwhile I cannot even figure out how to study to get Bs. I am happy for them but wish that success for myself as well. Welp, thats my rant! Thanks for listening! \n\nTLDR; Medical School Is Hard.",

I knew I wanted to be a doctor when I was young.  But instead of actually working hard and studying, I chose to procrastinate and fuck around as an undergrad.\n\nI could have gone to a Carribbean school, but I wanted more options when I graduated.  So I stuck it out here, got a job in the biotech industry doing research, got my EMT certification, retook classes on the side and aced that shit, enrolled in a part time masters program and aced that shit, took the MCAT and aced that shit, did all that to get into an SMP, aced that shit, and am now matriculating at that same med school.\n\nYea that's my story.  I obviously went through hell to get into a US MD school and I would never recommend doing this to anyone.  If you value your sanity, happiness, and money, don't be a dumbass like I was in undergrad and take it seriously.\n\nAnyway, my concerns are:\n\n1)  Do you ever feel \"behind\" compared to your younger classmates?\n\nObviously your priorities change as you get older.  Being young and single in med school must be nice, however, sadly that boat has passed for me.  At my age, the pressure to find someone to settle down and start a family is real.  Although most people my age have already found someone, I'm wondering how older single guys fared in this situation.\n\nObviously getting married and having kids while in med school when your broke is impossible.  Getting married and having kids during residency is impossible when your broke and working 100 hour weeks.\n\nDo you guys ever feel behind compared to your younger peers since they will not have to wait till they are close to 40 to start a family?  That they will also be in a better financial position than you are earlier in life etc?  \n\nI try not to let this negative shit get to me, but sometimes I wish I had the problems of a 22 year old kid instead of mine.  I wish my \"problems\" were as basic as trying to balance med school and beer pong.\n\n2)  Do you feel like more competitive specialties are not feasible for you due to your age?\n\nFor example, my dream specialty is ortho.  But if I'm going to be starting a 5 year residency at 32-33 and finishing everything by 40, that means no time for family or kids or buying a house, etc.  Which doesn't really make any sense.  Ortho residency is already brutal, adding a wife and kids to that is not something I see as practical or doable.\n\n3)  Are there any positive experiences in med school you would attribute to your age?\n\nAs much as I wish I was a 22-24 year old M1, sadly I can't turn back time.  So what are some positive experiences you have had as an older student compared to your younger peers?\n\n",

        "post": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a rising M2 and had an extremely difficult first year, for multiple reasons. All throughout undergrad, I idealized med school and put it on a pedestal in my mind of being the end-all be-all place to be. I felt academically successful and confident up until my first year of med school. I had a good group of supportive friends in undergrad and thought I would meet even more like-minded people in med school. \n\nMy actual experience in med school has been SO much different than what I expected. My school has multiple campuses and the one that I\u2019m at has around 40 students total and I haven\u2019t found a single person I really click with. I\u2019ve tried hanging out with my classmates outside of school and it just feels awkward and forced. When we\u2019re in class, all anyone talks about is how many anki cards they did over the weekend or how \u201cbehind\u201d they are when in reality, they\u2019re 3 lectures ahead of me. My friends in undergrad never talked about that stuff or made me feel like I wasn\u2019t doing enough. I\u2019ve made multiple attempts with different people to study together, but no one ever wants to. I\u2019ve never felt more alone and isolated.\n\nI thought I would actually enjoy my classes and find the content really interesting, but that also ended up not being the case. That caused a small identity crisis in itself because I kept thinking, \u201cif I want to be a doctor, shouldn\u2019t I find this material fun and exciting to learn about?\u201d On top of that, I\u2019m not even GOOD at studying anymore, which is something I\u2019ve been good at my whole life. Even after a whole year of med school, I don\u2019t have a study strategy nailed down and feel like I\u2019m BSing it every day. I\u2019ve passed all my classes thankfully, but I feel like an imposter who\u2019s just gotten lucky. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve actually retained much and that I\u2019m just faking it all. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I just can\u2019t help but wonder if anyone else has felt this way and wouldn\u2019t mind sharing their perspective. School was the one thing I enjoyed growing up and was actually good at, and now it just sucks and I\u2019m struggling with how to deal with it.\n\nTLDR; Med school is not as great as I thought it would be and the fact that I don\u2019t enjoy my classes and don\u2019t have friends in my class makes it that much harder. Not being good at studying makes me not even want to study, which causes procrastination and more anxiety - what do I do?\n\nEdit: I also want to add that I\u2019m new to Reddit/this sub and would appreciate any advice/stories you all have to share!",

My parents have spent their entire life's savings to send me to med school, what the hell do i do?\nI can't tell this to anyone probably ranting here would finally give me the courage to get into it and start doing it. One day at a time.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for responding guys. It truly means a lot.\n\nEdit 2: I am genuinely sorry. This wasn't meant to be a \"humble brag\" as some of you have pointed out. I actually don't read textbooks and i thought that I was doing something very wrong because all my professors ask us to do the same. They say that a good base can only be built by reading texts. So I was genuinely confused. I also plan on giving the USMLE so I thought that reading from standard texts is very important to perform well in that.\nAgain I apologise if I wasted your time. Please have a good day:)",

        "post": "This might be a vastly unpopular opinion but I needed this message a year ago. So fuck it. Dare i say 1st year wasnt that bad. In fact, i kinda had fun?!? Hear me out.. I remember the anxiety of starting. I had set out on a journey to become the Worlds Best Medical Student. I suddenly was going to transform into the most productive bushytailed brighteyed medical student i dreamt of becoming. Overly dedicated, over-confident, and most importantly delusional. The second coming of King Julien-med student edition. \n\nI scoured reddit all summer looking for ways to prepare myself. Anki this anki that. Ipad or no ipad? I became inundated with so many resources that I ended up just doing- nothing\u2728Dreams faded into reality. Claps and congratulations faded away. And the real work started. Slowly but surely you get into your routine and the school part of medicine becomes just like everything else monotonous. But, I slept 8hrs most days (except night before exams). I binged watched netflix. I took trips. I prioritized myself. I probably procrastinated more than I ever have.\n\nTruth is I didnt have to change much academically. Med school has its ups and its downs but for the most part its as much as you put into it. Theres nothing cooler than holding a brain for the first time. Or when you comfort a patient for the first time and they tell you, you will be a fine doctor one day. Or scrubbing into your first OR case and assisting with a BKA. If you made it in, you are more than capable of making it out. You grow close to some of the most interesting people you will ever meet in life. You also question how others managed to pass CASPER. Many will be smarter than you, others not so lol\u2026 but we all have one thing in common- we work f*%? hard -all of us. Grit, humility, and adaptability will take you far.\n\nMed school will challenge you. You will be stretched thin. Personally, You will grow at an ungodly speed. But though the days are longggg, the year is short. Enjoy your time off this summer, it makes no sense to stress in advance, save that for your cardio block. Before you know it, the dust settles and you see the third coming of King Julien on First Look-bright eyed and bushy tailed. You\u2019ll chuckle.",

        "post": "Barely passing, yet still find it hard to care more. The 12 hours before the exam is always filled with crazy studying and anxiety. I always have great plans with Anki, 3rd party resources, etc, but never follow through despite being in a ton of debt.\n\nI'm solidly in the bottom 5 students in my class of 180, but I'd rather not be scrambling last minute for a passing grade. I find it really hard to stay on top of my studies though and I think it's mostly because I never feel motivated. In hindsight, the MCAT is really the only test I've ever felt motivated not to procrastinate for even though in hindsight I kind of did because I really only gave it 6 weeks. I've never been motivated by anything academic but I'm really tired of the last minute stress of cramming to barely pass.\n\nAny tips for more healthy and sustainable motivation from the formerly lazy and unmotivated? Step is coming up next semester and I need to figure this out.\n\nThanks!",

        "post": "I'm a first year medical student who might have to repeat this year. I did fine academically, scoring above average on almost every test. My problem is that I procrastinated on turning in my immunizations for 6 months, and now the system is deregistering me. I no longer have access to some student services, and my name doesn't show up on some of my classes anymore. \n\nYou might say, why not just turn in your immunizations? Well, a month ago I started really working on that, but it turns out that I don't have any immunity to HepB, and the vaccine course is 4 months. Basically I won't be able to get it done till first year has already ended.\n\nI'm going in to talk to administration tomorrow, but I'm really scared that they might just kick me out for procrastinating for so long. If I do end up repeating a year, what do I do? Could I just do a research year? Would I have to repeat all of first year?\n\nAll of the other discussions on repeating a year were about students who failed classes. I'm not in that boat. I'm wondering if anyone else has been in my situation.",

I am easily distracted, and often I feel as if I compulsively look for distractions.\n\nI worry that this is affecting my learning and my performance (I've been performing at a satisfactory level so far, but definitely not up to my full potential since I spend my time so inefficiently).\n\nAny advice on how to overcome these behaviors, or perspectives from people who have dealt with a similar problem?

I feel like this might have been asked before but I want to know how you guys all manage to study throughout med school effectively lol.\n\nI barely scraped by my first year and the way my school runs is basically all self taught (we only have 4 cumulative exams throughout the entire year to consolidate all our knowledge). It also doesn't help that I'm a major procrastinator and find it hard to stay self motivated when there's nothing like regular check in quizzes or tests to hold you accountable. I guess I'm having a tough time trying to understand whether I should be focusing on the school provided resources or whether I should just get a third party like amboss and teach myself that way. Idk if it's relevant but I'm also planning on writing the USMLE step 1 at the end of this year. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what resources to use/how to efficiently study throughout med school bc im tryna avoid the struggle i went through in first year LOL.\n\nThanks for all your help!",

Lots of the time wasted goes to gaming, watching youtube and reddit, i don't even give myself time to read a book i like or exercise.\n Don't get me wrong, i love videogames and such but it feels like i instantly prefer doing \"low effort\" activities with the excuse of \"i don't have time for that\" while wasting time or at least not focusing it on studying.\n\nDoes it happen to anyone else?

My medical school isn\u2019t based in the US, and we follow the 6 year system (three years of preclinical, three years of clinical). \n\nFor some background information: I skipped the first year of medical school, and went straight into second year. Since then, I\u2019ve really been struggling. Medical school has been so mentally taxing; the content itself is easy enough to understand, but I find it so incredibly boring that I end up not studying at all, or procrastinating everything to the last minute. \n\nSomehow, I\u2019ve managed to pass my exams with the most mediocre grades (low Bs and Cs), but it\u2019s hard not to feel like an absolute failure, especially when so many of my friends are doing much better than I am. \n\nI\u2019ve had little to no motivation to work, and I\u2019d say most of it is due to how boring I find the content. Apart from our neuroscience module, which I really enjoyed, everything else, especially anatomy, bores me beyond belief. When I try and study the content, attempting to focus ends up making me sleepy, and I nap for hours instead of working. I\u2019m trying to find it interesting but I just can\u2019t, and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. I\u2019m determined to do better for clinical years, since I see as a fresh start of sorts, but I don\u2019t know how to do better.\n\nPeople have told me that to do well in clinical years, you HAVE to study consistently. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to achieve that - I can\u2019t even bring myself to go to lectures, since sitting there and listening for 4+ hours is just so mentally exhausting and I find it really difficult to focus. On top of that, I\u2019ve never had to work consistently hard to the level that my seniors have described, so I\u2019m worried that if I do end up grinding for 6+ hours a day, I\u2019ll just burn myself out, which will be worse in the long term. \n\nI\u2019m sure everyone has faced this kind of struggle; not all the content is going to be interesting, and I\u2019m not expecting it to be. I just have no clue how I can motivate myself to do better, despite knowing I should. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

I received medication and I am currently on it but I still find myself struggling to begin studying, losing focus a lot (less than before but still a lot) and generally doing tons of procrastination daily. We all know that medical school is not the place to have such issues and I am falling behind again and despite having the intentions to sit down and catch up and do a lot of studying I just fall in the same loop again and again and it really has become a huge burden that is draining me on a daily basis. The last thing I want is to keep going like this and then drop out, because I love medicine and everything about it, I just cannot afford to give up on it. The medication is helping me but not enough and I am on a pretty high dose so everything that has to change traces back to me. Is anyone here an ADHD medical student that can give me advice or his story with coping while going through medical school? I will appreciate every response and thank you in advance.",

        "post": "PGY-1 here approaching the end of intern year. As I\u2019m sitting here procrastinating Step 3 studying while on Reddit (some things never change), I was reflecting on where my headspace was a year ago today. This is a post for those that are incredibly terrified about what next week might bring in terms of the Match. I want to serve as (albeit rare) example that the unlikely can happen. I\u2019ve made a post about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/tkjdsx/a_statistical_anomaly_a_story_of_success/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) but the tl;dr is this: sometimes things that seem so far out of reach can happen. I set my sights on anesthesia prior to entering medical school, ended up matching into the field as a dual applicant though only having one interview. \n\nI know how miserable I was this time last year- distracting myself with anything and everything that wasn\u2019t medicine related because I was in denial.  At 9 ranks, I knew that I was in a decent spot to match, though not by comfortable margins compared to some of my classmates. Unfortunately, the Match is out of our hands. Some people will receive the best news of their life next week, while others might receive the worst. Try to get some sleep, rest, and enjoy the excitement of making it this far in your medical education career. You\u2019ve earned it. Things don\u2019t always work out the way we anticipate, but that doesn\u2019t always mean the end of the road.  \n\nSitting through long days of off-service rotations for a majority of this first year of anesthesia residency has given me a lot of context I wish I would have had in the event I did not get lucky and match into the field. We all work so hard. At the end of the day, having to take additional time to work toward your ideal goal will only make you a more rounded physician in the long run- even if it means SOAPing or reapplying the next year.  Sometimes the path to reaching our goals isn\u2019t a straight line.\n\n I realize how fortunate I am to have ended up in my situation and know that it unfortunately can\u2019t happen to everyone. But I hope you all can take a few moments to appreciate all the hurdles you\u2019ve had to jump though, all the sacrifices you\u2019ve made to get to this point. \n\nHang in there! Next week is coming up fast, for better or for worse- though I hope it\u2019s for the better. \n\nFeel free to reach out to me with any questions or even if you just need somewhere to channel some anxiety or stress!\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit 2: I am losing access to this Reddit account. I would be happy help in any way I can. Message me on my new account: tossawaysies69 ",

        "post": "Hey guys, current M1 here. As we're approaching the end of the semester, is anyone else dealing with trouble focusing? I feel like I've been working so hard all semester. I've been trying to take care of myself by getting plenty of sleep, working out, and taking breaks to do things I enjoy. Grade wise I'm doing much better than I expected, but I've gotten to a point where I just feel so sick of studying. The closer I get to the end of the semester, the more I feel my motivation waning, and consequently the more I fool around and waste time. I keep trying to designate time to relax so I don't get burned out, but I can't seem to pull myself out of my breaks anymore. Knowing that I'm almost done with the semester only seems to make it worse, because I know that in about a month I'll be relaxing by the fire without a care in the world. I'm worried that I'm going to lose the grades that I've worked so hard for. \n\nHow do y'all deal with losing motivation? And what advice do you have to counter act procrastination?",

        "title": "For those with addictive personalities, have you found it easier to finish everything you need to do before taking any breaks/relaxing rather than taking breaks/relaxing in between periods of work? [Well-being]",
        "post": "Just to be clear: I'm not asking this question for the weird mf'ers who for some reason have this alien thing called \"self-discipline\" and/or \"an intrinsic drive to accomplish everything.\" I'm asking this question to those like me who have addictive personalities and would fuck around on Youtube/reddit/twitch/whatever other mind-numbing crap all day if they didn't have any real-world responsibilities.\n\nSo after I didn\u2019t perform to my standards on my Anatomy final, I actually decided to make a study plan for once in my academic career (apart from when I studied for the MCAT) in order to not be so behind for my next module's tests. I even tried to set specific times for when I would go to sleep and wake up each day, as well as time blocking certain parts of the day just for Anki (my school's lectures are non-mandatory, so it's basically free for all rn). To my surprise (not really lmao), I failed miserably to keep up with my routine after the second day. Eventually, I guess I'll try again to make a routine for myself (maybe at least having a set sleep/wake up time?) so that I can have something constant in my life, but for right now, I\u2019m just trying to do the best I can without having too rigid of a schedule/routine (for me). \n\nBasically what that means is I\u2019ve just been sticking to a \u201cto-do list\u201d rather than setting certain times for doing certain things. I divide the amount of cards/boards videos that I need to do for a certain week evenly into each day so that I have an idea of how much I need to do. Man, I cannot even begin to describe how good I felt after the first day when I actually stuck to my to-do list and finished everything I needed to do for once in my life! However, history repeats itself, and once again, I was not able to finish everything on my list that I had on the following day. I was crushed, as you might imagine.\n\nI feel like the culprit for why I wasn\u2019t able to keep up with my to-do list for the second day (and the days thereafter) is the fact that I take breaks in between cards/videos. After I finish a BnB video and do the relevant AnKing cards, I sometimes feel drained and tell myself \u201cI\u2019ll just watch a few YT videos/browse reddit/Twitch for 15-20 and get right back to the next video!\u201d Inevitably, of course, a few YT videos turns into a couple of hours and the sunk cost fallacy and just plain stupidity prevents me from getting back to work because I think \u201cWhelp looks like there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be able to finish everything else on my list, might as well vegetate for the rest of the night\u201d instead of just getting back to work and salvaging whatever time I have left before it's like 3 AM and I haven't even done half of the new cards I should've done.\n\nSo, to those who have a similarly addictive personality to mine and are prone to procrastination and sunk costs like I am, I must ask: have you ever experimented with foregoing any type of entertainment/relaxing until you\u2019ve completely finished all of your work? For me, it\u2019s either all work or all play it seems. In fact, the first day I implemented my to-do list plan and actually followed through, was a day where I just pushed through all 4 boards videos and 400+ new cards and saved Youtube till only after I finished everything (albeit obviously I didn\u2019t have enough time to watch as much Youtube as I would have had I interspersed procrastination time in between cards and because I was getting tired). \n\nI know that for the long run, foregoing recreation until all work is done rather than interspersing it between can lead to burnout, but in the interest of me actually getting what I need to get done each day, would just going cold-turkey with any form of entertainment until I\u2019ve finished all tasks for the day be a viable plan? One way I can see this going horribly wrong is the days where I have so much to do that there is simply no time left over for relaxing at the end of the day. I\u2019d just like to try, however, and then maybe find a way to deal with those days when they come (i.e. maybe just giving myself permission to vegetate the following day if it\u2019s a weekend?)\n\nThanks for reading and for any advice!",

I'm balancing\u00a0***life things***\u00a0fine \u2013 eating well (enough), exercising a couple times a week, seeing my friends and family on weekends when I drive back home. But my struggle comes from my discipline and motivation to learn and retain the content I'm learning.\n\nBasically, my med school course is 1 year of preclinical and 3 years of clinical... and I feel like I'm just scraping through this single year of pre-clinical content. I know that ***most*** medical schools do their pre-clinical content over 2 or even 3 years... but I don't want to use the volume of what I'm learning as an excuse.\n\nI just... don't want to study??? Let alone cover the pre-work needed for all my classes during the week. It seems like I can balance everything in my life\u00a0**except**\u00a0for the study aspect \u2013 which is arguably one of the more important things when it comes to my career.\n\nI know it's typical for med students to think they're not studying or doing enough. But I mean this in the most objective sense... I have not touched course material in 9 weeks. I have no notes. I have no Anki flashcards relevant to the content. AND\u2013 I only\u00a0***just***\u00a0have an idea of the topics we learnt because I managed to attend my classes at the very least. Whenever I sit down to study, I end up using the time to organise folders or do my assignments (which are on things that I can easily research, bs, or both). Before I know it, I get too tired and end up going to bed.\n\nWhen it comes to exams... I don't perform well. I didn't pass my mid-semester exams (which is okay because it was worth nothing). I also barely scraped through my end of semester exam.\n\nI'm so anxious to engage in group study because my friends are such bright people; I don't want to be a hindrance if I study alongside them. They ask me to study with them often... but I'm embarrassed since I literally know nothing. I'm never able to add anything of substance when they're talking about the content. I don't even think they know how behind I am on the content tbh ://\n\nI also have exams in just under 2 months... and I'm ridden with feelings of anxiety because I just know I'm not mentally prepared to study any of the content learnt this year. I feel so incompetent for being so incapable of just sitting down and studying. Why is it so hard for me to do that?? Any advice, anecdotes, or anything of the sort would be greatly appreciated.

Studying is both much easier and much harder. \nIt\u2019s so nice to be using NBME exams instead of professor written ones. I\u2019ve done so much better gpa wise than in preclinical despite having much less time to study, as I don\u2019t have to care what lectures covered.\n\nBut on some rotations, especially Surgery, with 12 hours shifts and 1 weekend day off, if was hard to get in the time to study when you\u2019re more exhausted. \nThis got easier later in the year due to overlap (eg a question is both pediatrics and surgery uworld sections, so you\u2019ll do it in whatever clerkship you have first and then have one less to do in the later clerkship. I also had to use amboss in some rotations as a booster due to the overlap though.\n\n2. There can be a lot of unfairness built into the system, and the school doesn\u2019t care.\nFor some rotations, there were good and bad sites. Some were much more far away than others. Some had very short hours versus long (for surgery in particular anesthesia had like 40% the hours of transplant). For some clerkships we ranked (got my 10/11 surgery rank), for others assigned, but as you can\u2019t appeal, it doesn\u2019t really matter if you rank of not, as everyone wants certain sites.\nEven for the exact same site, it can be a great experience one week with resident and attending a and b, and awful the next with resident c and d. One site I was at the previous group got out at 12, while the attending the next week had us sit around in the dark, hot workroom until 6:30 just in case something came up (it did 1/10 days)\n\n3. Evals are a washup \nI got meh evals in rotations where I really tried and good ones where I maybe deserved meh. It depends more on department vibes and evaluator preference than what I\u2019ve actually done. Always try your best,but don\u2019t be too bummed if your eval doesn\u2019t match.",

        "post": "I\u2019m an MS1, posting on my throwaway. I\u2019m suspicious that I have had underlying ADHD for a long time. I showed many of the childhood symptoms (teachers commenting on self-control issues and hyperactivity, fidgeting, some poor social skills), and I think I show adult symptoms too. I have trouble focusing, like I\u2019ll watch a lecture and I\u2019m on my phone within 5 minutes. Or even in the middle of a one-on-one conversation with someone, I\u2019ll zone out and miss everything they say. Chores are nearly impossible to do, and I maintain some fidgeting habits (mostly nail biting, to the point that my nails are disfigured and painful). I\u2019m also extremely forgetful, which is probably the only thing that has actually caused problems (mostly with my girlfriend when I forget things she\u2019s already told me multiple times). \n\nThe thing that makes me question myself is that I haven\u2019t *really* seen direct negative life impacts. I have coping strategies for many things (e.g. fidget toys for nail biting, countless iPhone alarms and notes so I don\u2019t forget tasks), and I have always been good at school, so even with much less studying than my peers, my grades have been average/slightly above average this far through M1. But it feels like I\u2019m skimming by on test taking skills and prior knowledge while I\u2019m not actually learning anything long run, and it doesn\u2019t feel sustainable.\n\nAnyway, this turned into a ramble. I\u2019ve already decided I\u2019m going to talk to a professional, so I\u2019m not looking for a diagnosis or anything like that from Reddit. **I\u2019m just looking to hear what was your \u201cfinal straw\u201d that made you want to get help.** For me, it was an old friend of mine at another med school who got diagnosed after having many similar symptoms, and who said that treatment has changed his life.\n\nEdit: thanks everyone who\u2019s shared. It\u2019s crazy hearing descriptions of behaviors that I\u2019ve done for years in many of you. The support means a lot!",

        "post": "I am an MS2 student and well, it's been hell you guys.\n\nI've always had some anxiety related to studying. You know that Asian Dad meme? Well, that's my Dad, only with yelling and throwing things. I have minimum contact now, but the anxiety has persisted. Yet, it never effected my success until MS2. I was an exceptional student in undergrad (Phi Beta Kappa) and then did about average during MS1 (80's-85's), with a decent work/life balance. Not great, but decent. Then this year, IDK, something just snapped...\n\nIt started off bad right from the beginning and just got worse. I would sit down to study and suddenly feel this overwhelming sense of dread, like maybe I am too dumb to understand the material or maybe I won't have time to get through everything. To escape the anxiety, I'd end up procrastinating, spending hours and hours on Reddit or watching TV. For several months, I thought I was just being a lazy asshole, so I tried drafting and redrafting schedules, blocking time wasters on my computer, and banning all distractions until it was just me in a room at the library with printed out PowerPoint slides. But even then, it was just me staring at the wall, heart racing, literally just *thinking* about studying for hours. I started to get nauseous during panic attacks and developed heart palpitations, which I actually got an ECHO for. Not cheap. Soon, the anxiety invaded my home life. I stopped going to the gym, reading, watching my shows, even eating because I felt I needed all that time to \"catch up.\" But instead, I just stared at the wall. Procrastination caused more and more responsibilities to pile on, exacerbating the anxiety, until a week or a half week before the exam, when my fear of failing out miraculously overcame my fear of studying and I'd knock out 18hr days and go into the exam with 1-2hrs sleep or less.\n\nJust to be clear, I haven't failed any classes. I actually passed my last block with points to spare, though I am no longer at the class average. I've failed my most recent exam, but not by more than a few percentage points. Case in point, I can recover...but should I? Originally, I planned to just power through all of this, but after winter break and talking to a few trusted people, I'm not sure if that's the smartest move.\n\nI could probably do it...I could pass this block, the next few after that, and possibly even Step I. I've already gotten in touch with the dean, my academic adviser, and set up appointments with the school's counseling center. I am confident I could keep going and, you know, not totally fail out.\n\nBut...for one, I am completely burnt out. It's in my nature to push myself in school, to stack on the extracurriculars, to be social and active and fun. But the motivation is gone and it's scaring me; never before have I felt this...apathetic. Then there's the grades themselves, dragging down my class ranking and as such, AOA is falling out of reach. On top of that, I am well aware that Step I scores correlate with MS2 grades and I haven't once gotten through all the material for a single exam. Not once. Not even close. \n\nI want to take a LOA, maybe even re-take MS2 if they let me. I want to take the time to re-charge, figure out what I want in terms of work/life balance, and learn to finally address this studying anxiety I have been having for years. Potentially, I could take a full month off to just re-charge, then use self-study (First Aid 2015 and a QBank) to work on my weaker subjects, while simultaneously using the experience to work through my studying anxiety with a psych. The school counselor even suggested I go on meds, so I could find a cocktail I am comfortable with.\n\nBut I don't want to be a total idiot either. I don't want to just run away from my problems by taking a LOA, or set myself up for failure with a big fat red flag on my resume. I am seeing my academic adviser to discuss some of this stuff tomorrow, but wanted an outside perspective from fellow students as well, maybe those going through the same thing. Is this a good idea, or should I suck it the fuck up and slough through the next six months? \n\nThanks, I know it's lengthy; it feels good even to type it out.",

        "title": "[Vent] Using Anxiety to Cope with Difficult situations",
        "post": "Med student here, finishing up their last month of Year 2 (preclinical). I think I came to a very difficult realization today, after weeks of spiraling anxiety and depression. As we near the end of the year, the stress ramps up as we are devoting more and more of our time to studying for our preclinical comprehensive exams/OSCEs and realizing just how much we are expected to know. The comprehensive exam doesn\u2019t worry me as much, as I'm the kind of person who is good at writing tests because I get a lot more time to think things through and because nobody is watching me while I do it, but when it comes to practical/hands on things like taking a history or doing a physical exam (where I'm usually in a small room being watched by several other people), my nerves will get the best of me and I'll forget the simplest of things or make really stupid mistakes. \n\n\nAll too often, I blame my own inherent stupidity and incompetence. I double down and study harder, amping myself up with coffee and purposely making myself more anxious because I feel that I need to be more \"mentally vigilant\" to be able to think clearly. And every time I do, it just makes it harder to think and act properly. I become more impulsive, I forget things, and my ability to string words together takes a huge toll. I compare myself to others whose words seem to flow effortlessly in a beautiful way, and decide that I just need to force myself to be a more eloquent person, calculating my words like I would a math equation. \n\n\nAnd my colleagues (thankfully, we are in the same small groups generally throughout the whole year, so only a few get to see me in action) watch me crash and burn meanwhile they do better each time until they are all but perfect. Not only do I feel that they are judging me hard and wondering how I got into medical school in the first place, but it makes me acutely believe that I'll never be as good as them, that the gap between us will never close - even as I accumulate more and more knowledge and clinical skills through hard work, I feel frustrated that I can't seem to utilize it well when it really matters. After each time I mess up I can feel their respect for me erode.\n\n\nAll of this came to a head for me yesterday when we took part in a Breaking Bad News communication session meant to teach us in small groups with a standardized patient on how to use the SPIKES protocol. Basically we started by taking a simple history, with a 5 minute debrief, followed by 10 minutes of breaking bad news, and feedback. I was the last person to go in my group of 4, and everyone who went before me did basically a perfect job or made no real major mistakes, so I felt right off the bat that the bar had been set very high. I was sweating hard and shaking by that point, couldn't think straight, and I just knew that my words weren't going to come out right. So then its my turn to go up, and I'm sitting in the hot seat in a small room where the other three were watching intently.\n\n\nI followed the formula for the first half of the history, but this patient was an adolescent and when it came to the social history I completely panicked and found that I couldn't word anything clearly to the patient and they were getting confused. They also mentioned a detail about their own life that turned out to be crucial for the case, but since I was so anxious I couldn't remember if the patient had mentioned it earlier (and that I had just forgot). So I nodded along pretending that I understood what the patient was saying and continued on with the rest of my history. At the end when it came time for debrief, the preceptor asked me questions about that specific detail and I had no idea so I blurted out something that was completely wrong. The other three were trying not to laugh. In hindsight I knew I should have explored that detail about the patient more, but I was too afraid to reveal my ignorance on that subject that I decided to ignore it instead of delving deeper.\n\n\nAt that moment I wished that the ground would swallow me up and I could disappear. I felt such shame but continued onwards with the Breaking Bad News. Only I was so nervous I didn't properly read the prompt and told some incorrect details to the patient. I also broke the bad news too abruptly, I didn't mean to, but I involuntary blurted out some of the words and by then it was too late to take them back. I think the standardized patient and the preceptor pitied me, and I was very self-critical and apologetic so they went easy on me with the feedback.\n\n\nI felt utterly demoralized... and I so badly wanted my group members to validate me in some way... to tell me it was okay, or that I had had a hard case and it was understandable. But I think they had already judged me as being a lost cause, and unworthy of their respect. I couldn't really blame them, what I did was really quite pathetic. Fearing I would further reveal my incompetence and seem pathetic if I spoke to any of them about it, I mustered up a fake smile and carried on as if nothing had happened. That day I got home and ran straight to bed. I felt like I could just sleep forever.\n\n\nI woke up today and did a lot of soul searching. I had a clinical round in the morning where my preceptor basically gives me free reign to see patients and do complete histories and physicals. Although after what happened yesterday I was not feeling up to it, I mustered up the energy to put on a smile and reassured myself that there was nothing to be nervous about, as nobody was watching me (except the patient). It was like a flip had been switched in my brain - suddenly the words were flowing effortlessly out of my mouth and I seemed to know just what to do, and just what to ask/say next. Everything I had learned in the past 2 years came bubbling to the surface. It felt like I'd been transformed into a completely different person, from the babbling idiot I had been yesterday. \n\n\nAfter the rotation, I reflected on yesterday's events and realized, if I had simply not been so anxious, I could have given myself more time to consider my words and actively listen more to the patient and understand. It made me realize that all too often, I blamed my actions on being inherently incompetent, dumber than others. I compared myself to them and it made me lose trust in my own abilities. I would pour my energy into imitating them, and hoping to do well enough to save face, rather than seeing these sessions as learning experiences, and giving myself more room to make mistakes. If I was more kind to myself, and gave myself the time and space to really understand, instead of react, to what was going on around me, all of the insecurities and feelings of failure would simply melt away. I DO have the potential to be a good doctor in the future. My clinical round this morning proved that I'm not inherently stupid or faulty, I just sometimes let my anxiety get the better of me. Am I going to be able to change the impression I made on some of my classmates? Probably not. But why should I care? I have friends who do see the good in me and value me for who I am, so why try in vain to change myself for people who will never see me as anything more than an incompetent fool? Just strive to be the best version of myself. The only thing I can do is try to prove them wrong in the end.\n\n\nTo summarize, I guess the takeaway lesson here is to be kind to yourself, and to realize, yes, you got into medical school, clearly they saw something in you and you are capable of becoming a great doctor. When faced with a difficult situation, it can be tempting to spiral into self doubt, concluding that because you made a mistake, you are inherently flawed and defective, and then try to fight your way out of it. All too often, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy when you let anxiety and stress get to your head, when all you needed was to slow down, relax, and trust in yourself. I read an article today that addressed this, and cited a paper that showed, when you are more anxious, your brain is actually LESS inhibited and more impaired in its decision making abilities. Which in hindsight perfectly explained my actions and how I could be so different from day to day. When I allowed myself to relax, there was a noticeable change that took place - my words and my actions suddenly became much more deliberate, and more controlled. I was able to act much more in accordance with my true thoughts/feelings/desires. I think this is something that applies not only to medical school but to life in general. \n\n\nMy thinking problems weren\u2019t just isolated to school. I found myself become more and more withdrawn and antisocial in the past few weeks due to the stress of everything. I was becoming more absent minded, losing things, and procrastinating more. I\u2019m glad I was able to stop that vicious cycle of negative self evaluation before it might have cost me my relationships, my grades, my dignity, who knows what else. I\u2019m by no means perfect and I definitely do have my inherent weaknesses and flaws \u2013 I\u2019ll never be as intelligent or poised as some. But I can definitely learn to accept myself more day by day and understand that this can only help me in my future career, that self-acceptance is not the same thing as complacency and weakness. \n\nTL;DR: \n\n-MS2 with performance anxiety in structured group learning\n \n-Had traumatizing experience caused by anxiety \n\n-Realized the anxiety was making everything worse\n\n-Take home message: be kind to yourself, trust in your own abilities, don't mind what other people think\n",

Additionally, the clinical skills curriculum in the pre-clinical phase could include a surgical skills component that would introduce students to knot tying and suturing early on.\n\nI say this only because surgical training is already soo long, with all the research years and subspecialty training, that it just makes sense to speed it up where you can.\n\nI imagine a program like this would have 1-2 spots reserved in their residency class for these accelerated students, and students could possibly get the added bonus of skipping Step 2, making this a very enticing but competitive program. The downside is that you have to complete residency at the same hospital that is affiliated with your medical school.\n\nBut we know this will never happen because $$$$$$.\n\nOk back to UWorld.",

        "post": "Like the title says, I need help conquering procrastination. I started to struggle with this before the pandemic hit, putting things off until the last minute or missing deadlines entirely, and I am having worse problems with time management now. \n\nIn the past, everything had a deadline that was controlled by others. Even the push for tenure involved a ticking clock. Now, the flexibility of my days is killing productivity and I can't snap out of it. Even though I have a lot to do, I sleep in until 10:00, watch three hours of Netflix, grade just enough to get students off my back, and then I'm tired and tell myself I will get back to that paper tomorrow--but the next day I do the exact same thing. I had a new prep this semester, and I put off getting ready for the class all winter break, even though I really wasn't doing anything else. I'm now just 12 hours ahead of students in terms of preparing for the class. It's awful.\n\nThe thing is, I really like my job. I teach interesting classes, and I am very interested in my research. But, it seems to take me 8 hours to finish things that should take 2 hours. When I'm at work, I socialize and tell myself that I will attend to necessary tasks when I'm home. When I'm home, my days are unstructured, and no matter how much I tell myself I'm going to stick to a schedule, I can't stick to it. \n\nI don't know if I am maybe suffering from depression (I have no motivation), or if I just never learned time management and I'm simply a horrible self starter. It is starting to hurt my career, but even knowing this, I repeat the same pattern of nothingness every day. \n\nAnyone else out there ever gone through something like this? If I hated my classes or didn't enjoy doing research, I would say it is job burnout or disappointment in the job itself, but those things aren't true. What is true is that I can outline project after project, download everything I need for the literature review, get everything set up and even start collecting data--but then I find something else that is just as interesting and I bounce to that topic. I am finishing nothing. I don't know what is wrong with me and I need advice. ",

        "post": "Cute alliteration aside, I think that my diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety is being made worse by the pandemic. In pre-pandemic times, it was often extremely difficult to start new tasks, whether it be grading, writing exams, working on the nominal amount of research I have to do to appease the school's accreditation body, or or doing lecture videos for my online classes. I procrastinated on almost everything. But I somehow got enough work done to be somewhat functional as an instructor because doing something productive would take away the guilt I felt about not working and make me hate myself just a little bit less. \n\nIn other words, for almost all of my career (beginning in grad school and now a NTT full-time instructor), my motivation to do most of my work has been to feel \"less bad\",  less guilty, rather than to feel a sense of accomplishment. But now, I'm pretty minimally functional. I'm working from home for safety and I have a little work area setup in my dining room (I don't have room for a proper office). It's mostly free of distractions, but now my procrastination is worse. Everytims I even think about working, I get waves of anxiety that make me want to just sit on the couch and surf reddit on my phone. \n\nThen emails come in from students wondering about when the next quiz or video will be posted (I change stuff each year to prevent cheating, and some videos are just outdated). I can feel my heart rate increase when I see these emails and I feel stupid because if I didn't procrastinate, this wouldn't happen. So then I feel yet more anxiety and guilt than makes it harder to actually get work done.\n\nAdd to this my depression that says nothing I have to teach is important and that teaching during these times is like polishing banisters on the Titanic. It's getting even harder to do things. I can post PowerPoints but the thought of doing recorded lectures fills me with dread, *even though I've been recording lectures for years for my classes.* I have trouble keeping up with my own syllabus schedule because I'm not releasing assignments on time, which makes it so that I have to extend my own deadlines in order to be fair to the class.\n\nI am on medication for depression and see a therapist. I guess I'm better off with them than without, but I don't feel like they help much. There are occasional good days where I am productive, but a lot of the time, I just want to give up.\n\nIs anyone else feeling something like this?",

        "title": "What counts as a reasonable accommodation, post-pandemic?",
        "post": "Prior to the pandemic, it was (seemingly) considered a reasonable accommodation to allow a students who missed an exam to make it up in person, in my office. It was also considered reasonable to require that missed assignments, quizzes, and exams be made up within a few days or by the end of the week. \n\nBut now, post-pandemic, it seems as though many students find these requirements unreasonable given that the technology clearly exists for them to complete almost any assignment (exams included) online, and assessments/assignments can easily be \"re-opened\" for them at a later date. And in once sense I get it - administrators encouraged/required us to provide loooooong grace periods for students who contracted COVID, allowing them to make up assignments sometimes weeks later. And completing a missed assessment online is certainly easier than trekking to a professor's office to do it in person. But on the other hand, allowing students to make up exams online essentially turns them into open-note, open-book exams, and this is undermines the assessment while being unfair to the other students in the course. And allowing open-ended deadlines on making up assignments often results in students procrastinating too long and then giving up on catching up (often resulting in a snow-ball effect, especially in an online course).\n\nThe issue is that when a student emails me about missing an assignment or exam, they often open by asking \"can I complete it online?\" and often also expect an unlimited timeframe for doing so. When I respond that they \"need to complete it in my office\" or that they have \"until Friday\" to submit something, I'm usually met with silence and a missed deadline. \n\nIs this because students think these formerly acceptable accommodations are unreasonable in post-pandemic academia? Should I take time to carefully explain my reasoning, rather than simply letting them know how/when something can be made up? But saying \"you can't take the exam from home because then you might use your notes/book\" doesn't seem like a good solution either. Appropriately accommodating students really feels like a no-win situation sometimes, and I'm struggling with how to best approach these situations in an ever-changing educational landscape.\n\n(Relatedly, I'd also love to hear any thoughts on a professor's obligation to reach out to students who have stopped engaging in a course.)",

It is frustrating and sometimes I fail, but overall teaching is the best part of my job and I love seeing young minds turn on to my subject or solve analytic problems.\n\n  \nBut I just can't get up the enthusiasm.  I'm teaching two hybrid courses (each with a small in-person component) and one online course and there are so many reasons I'm dreading it:\n\n1 - I'm way behind on prep.  This is a combination of anxiety-induced procrastination and the fact that, while I've taught all three of the courses, they're basically all new preps with the change in format.\n\n2 - I don't love online teaching in general.  It feels cold and impersonal and emphasizes the parts of my teaching that are the weakest, while de-emphasizing the stuff that I'm good at.\n\n3 - I'm worried that the small in-person teaching parts are going to give someone COVID.\n\n4 - I'm worried that my students will have many additional barriers to success this semester.  My students have plenty to begin with because of the student population, and the pandemic doesn't help. If last spring was any indicator, this semester will be hard on them.\n\n5 - General pandemic-induced dread/isolation.\n\n  \nAnyone else feeling this way?

I'm a 'hard professor' and Im okay with that. But everyone kept complaining and complaining, and I started to doubt myself, and got easier on the students, trying to not be hard, and to be nicer... and then all the students just quit working. \n\n\\-\n\nShould have stayed hard. About 4-5 weeks ago, attendance started to plummet. work started to plummet. attitudes started to plummet. and now here we are today. Final project is due in 7 days. It's a BIG project. We have two guest reviewers coming in, one flying in on their own expense, to review the projects. It's a big deal. As of monday, 50% of the class **hadn't even started.** Class is three hours long (i'm in the arts)  and Monday was litterally just me staring at a room of students (half of which were missing all together) while they STARTED to work on their projects. There was nothing for me to do but just wait out the clock. I coundn't even give feedback because so few had anything to show. And I've been on them -gently- for weeks. Trying not to be the 'hard professor'. You should really work on this. You are behind have you thought about coming to office hours, are you okay, email me with any questions, you seem really behind... fucking *nothing*. \n\n\\-\n\nSo today, i rage quit. for the day. emailed the class that class was canceled today. Honestly, im embarrassed for the guest reviewers to come, and if they hadn't already purchased airfare on their own dime i would cancel. I went on a mad dad email about how disappointed i was and broke down what was due when (there is a calendar that's been publicly available for weeks) and what percentage of the class was on top of shit. (roughly 6 out of 24 of them). no class. Not going to stare at the clock for 3 hours because there is nothing discuss and you haven't started a 4 week project that's due in 7 days. Told them I would be available during class time for 1-on-1 feedback for their projects, in any state. should they need. \n\n\\-\n\ntwo took me up on that offer. two, that of course are doing absolutely fine and have been more or less on top of shit the whole time. The ones that are drowning are still evidently oblivious to their impending doom.\n\n\\-\n\nI don't know if me trying to be the 'not hard professor' fucked the class. or its pandemic related, or somehow i just became immediately unlikable when i showed my belly or what. but this fucking class went WAY off the rails, and I can not wait for next week (Finals week) to be over. This is my 10th year of being a professor, and this is the second worst class i've ever had.",

My grading scheme, assignments, and exams have been basically unchanged over the past 5 years in this particular course, so the points based score (as opposed to the final curved letter grade) should be comparable over time.\n\nPre-COVID: The most common point score was in the B range [80 - 89.99], then As and Cs were about equally common, and there was a small tail of just under 10% Ds and Fs.\n\nYear with COVID restrictions {Fall 2020} (my school had masking, socially distanced classrooms, and quarantining for exposed students/faculty, with the expectation of simultaneous streaming for students who could not come to class): A grades drop sharpest, followed by Bs and Cs, with a big movement of mass to the D/F group. [Not a shock].\n\nNo major COVID restrictions {Fall 21 and 22}: A grades return almost to normal, but B grades fall even further. The mass that used to be in the B group pre-COVID gets spread pretty evenly over the Cs and the Ds. D/Fs are almost twice as frequent as they were pre-COVID.\n\nBefore starting this analysis, I wasn't sure if I agreed with the many posters about the change to a more bimodal distribution. I think some of the institutional characteristics of my school and the type of students we attract resist some of that shift. I really didn't see much of an increase in students quitting on the course (either by withdrawing or getting Fs by not doing assignments/tests). But even so, I'm seeing basically 15% of my students go from A/B to C/D grades.",

In all the years I've taught this class, no one has ever complained about these. One was a long rant about how late penalties are unfair and they don't reflect a students' true performance. Just stuff like that -- if they do the work, they should receive the grade they *deserve,* not have late penalties keep them from an A; they are being discriminated against and it's hurting their GPA. I've been overly lenient with Covid and was surprised by the complaining, and honestly, complaints in general have gone up. Like I am teaching mini cranky Karens. The average class GPA was 3.7!\n\nI thought university students understood that assignments have due dates, and professors can choose to not accept late work or add late penalties. Since I figure I'm these freshmans' orientation to university life. I'm considering adding a short section in my syllabus on why I have due dates and late penalties (my freshman syllabi are super detailed, while my upper-level classes are one page).\n\nI feel stupid for asking this, as I would never think to ask this a few years ago, but do any of you include the purpose of due dates and late penalties in your syllabi?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: wow. I posted this morning because I was a irritated by the students and didn't expect it to take off. I'm going to add an explanation in the FAQs. I teach about 1000 students in the combined sections and do everything I can to reduce email. I also have learned that I need a bulletproof syllabus in this class because students love to find loopholes and demand extra. I do know the problem ones don't listen in class and don't read the syllabus, but sometimes I cut and paste from the syllabus because I get tired of 100 emails about the same issue.   \n\n\nI also learned maybe I should avoid professor TikTok. I'm happy with my Asian cooking and funny Tiktoks",

        "post": "Hi all,\n\nAs I finished marking exams and am now procrastinating on some committee work I thought I would post a thought piece to generate some discussion.\n\nTo a large degree traditional Universities still operate in Semesters. There are generally 2 or 3 in a year. In each Semesters students complete 3 or 4 courses. As the Mandalorian may say 'This is the way'. The only real difference to the way Universities teach (not including Admin mandated changes to standards, marking, student interaction or economic cuts) was imposed by COVID.   \n\nWhat I am thinking is that degrees need to be made up lots more smaller courses, or more intense courses. Some option I would float are\n\n* Rather than doing 4 courses concurrently  across a 13 week semester, complete two subjects in an intense 6 week block, and then complete the other two in another 6 week block or \n* Break down a full 13 week courses into two six week courses. Why? \n\n1. Students who fail a course can't continue to the next course. You can think of it as scaffolding with consequences if you like. Students are therefore  'forced' to review material more regularly. \n2. The same concept is often taught in multiple courses. This would be a way to consolidate these courses.\n3. It's easier to offer the same course multiple times per year. If a student does fail a course, they do not need to wait for a year to retake the course.   \n4. It could be easier to describe exactly what a course covers and what a student is expected to know or be able to do. You could think of describing courses and outcomes in terms of competency statements.\n5. One assessment piece for each course. \n\n* For T&R academics there is a possibility of squeezing their teaching responsibilities into condensed blocks of time, leaving time for actual research.\n* It could be easier to update or introduce new courses. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post": "I was already having a pretty crummy day today, and then this lovely email hit my inbox.\n\nFor background: I just got done giving my midterm for my class of 200 students. I have been teaching online the last two semesters (COVID), but I have a set class time. Last semester I gave my exams during my class time, but there were some technical issues. (Thank you, Blackboard.) This semester, I decided to extend it to two days open rather than having everyone logged in at the same time. It was open from before class time on Monday until Tuesday at 5pm. Not only did I give them two days, I gave them multiple attempts. \n\nThen I got this email from a student today (Wednesday), after the deadline was over. The student hasn't contacted me all semester, much less to voice any concern about the format of the class or that they were having problems. All of my assignments are due at 5pm on the due date so I can finalize grading in the evening, but they're all open for a week or more before that deadline. I assume it goes without saying, but I'll mention that they are open 24 hours a day when they're open, except for the day they're due. \n\nI'll paraphrase to avoid identifiable bits, and to make it more grammatically sound.\n\n\"Professor, I want you to reopen the midterm exam for me. I had class on Tuesday morning and then I had to work until the evening. So I had no time for the exam. Apparently you have no heart, and you don't understand that students have obligations outside of school, or you would change the deadlines. The deadline of 5pm is ridiculous! It's affecting my grade! I can't do assignments because I'm at work past 5pm. You should take this into account and change the deadlines so that it's more convenient for me.\"\n\nI literally went cross-eyed reading this letter. WTF? I always get a few students who miss exams (inevitable with 200 students), but they're usually remorseful about missing and take responsibility for it. I don't think I've ever had someone just completely miss the exam and put the blame on me. And I don't even know what this student is talking about, since it was open all day Monday, too. \n\nWhat's more, I'd made them fill out an acknowledgment last week that included the times the midterm was open, basically agreeing that they were okay with this arrangement. I had even said I would work around student schedules, since I do know a lot of my students have other obligations. In fact, I'm back in graduate school myself, getting my ass kicked working and going to school myself. And I'm more lenient than normal because...COVID. \n\nWhat's saddest, I almost always open exams back up for students if they take responsibility for their actions and have a compelling reason for missing. But not in this case. If this student had just been honest and admitted they forgot or procrastinated because they have a lot going on, I probably would have let them take it for partial credit.",

I get it, it's a lot. I know mental health is bad. Never in my 5 years of teaching have I had this many students contact me 2 weeks after an assignment was due asking if they could still submit with decrease or no penalty.  It's not fair to students who get it in on time. It's not fair to me.  \n\nI know anxiety makes you procrastinate. But here's the kicker- procrastination and avoidance makes anxiety worse!  So we are actively increasing anxiety by giving extensions.  \n\nSo when do we put it back on the student to drop a course rather than bend over backwards and into pretzels handing out extensions? Isn't this the most reasonable, responsible, and honestly healthy way to approach it?  If you are overloaded, decrease your load. Don't ask others to carry it for you.

Source: [see here](https://beta.openai.com/playground?fbclid=IwAR2hfhMg05x2do1xJhYefMm63F5UvJUnvEFbD-cpRmE_coByiXtgsoiMCPw).  It seems like it could be used as an easy way to start a paper, and could present an issue for academic integrity, making it virtually undetectable when people plagiarize from an AI.\n\n It does not give the same answer if you give it the same prompt, instead appears quite flexible.  For example I gave it the prompt  \"Discuss the role of religion in Victorian England\" and it came back with \"The Victorian era was a time of great change in the country, and religious beliefs were a major factor in this change. The Church of England was the dominant religion in the country, and its influence was felt in all aspects of society. The Victorian era was also a time of great industrialization, and the rise of the middle class. This led to a change in the social hierarchy, and the Church of England began to lose its grip on power. The middle class began to challenge the Church's authority, and this led to a decline in its influence.\"  I deleted the response and asked it again and it said: \"In Victorian England, religion was a very important part of people's lives. Many people were members of the Church of England, and attendance at church was mandatory. The church was very involved in people's lives, and religious leaders were often consulted on important matters.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI proceeded to give it the \"Colbert Questionnert\" as prompts, and it gave the the following interview: \n\nQ: What is the best sandwich? AI: The best sandwich is the one that you like the most.\n\nQ: What is the scariest animal?  AI: There is no definitive answer to this question as different people are afraid of different animals. Some people may find spiders or snakes to be the scariest, while others may find sharks or bears to be more intimidating.\n\nQ: Apples or oranges?  AI: I prefer apples because they are sweeter and have a softer texture.\n\nQ: Have you ever asked someone for their autograph?  AI: Yes, I have asked people for their autographs. I have asked for the autographs of athletes, musicians, and actors.\n\nQ: What do you think happens when we die?  AI: Some people believe that when we die, we go to a better place where we will be reunited with our loved ones. Other people believe that our soul is recycled and we are reborn into another person or animal.\n\nQ: What is your Favorite action movie?  AI: My favorite action movie is The Bourne Identity. I love the Bourne movies because they are intense and thrilling. They are also clever and well-made. The Bourne Identity is my favorite because it is the first movie in the series and it sets the stage for the rest of the movies.\n\nQ: Favorite smell?  AI: I love the smell of lavender.\n\nQ: Least favorite smell?  AI: My least favorite smell is the smell of rotting food.\n\nQ: Exercise: worth it?  AI: The benefits of exercise far outweigh the costs. Exercise improves mental health, increases lifespan and protects against  obesity, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and memory decline.\n\nQ: Flat or sparkling? AI: I prefer sparkling water because it is refreshing and has a pleasant taste.\n\nQ: Most used app on your phone?  AI:  My most used app on my phone is probably Instagram.\n\nQ: You get one song to listen to for the rest of your life: what is it? AI: Livin' on a Prayer by Bon Jovi\n\nQ: What number am I thinking of?  AI: 26\n\nQ: Describe the rest of your life in 5 words  AI: Happily ever after with family\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway. I played with it for awhile, procrastinating. After a few interesting responses  I prompted it with: \"You are actually the best AI I've ever seen, you legit pass the Turing test\"\n\nIt said: Thank you for your compliment!",

        "post": "Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite. I have ADHD, plus major depressive disorder and anxiety.\n\nI had a student who would not leave me alone about opening assignments that already closed using their disabilities as an excuse, but they never reached out to the disability center until the last possible minute. I repeatedly told them time and time again to do this. Said student is super clingy, constantly emailing me every week, talking to me about their disability.\n\nThis semester is hell. Half the class has Fs--like, 0%...10% etc. \"What can I do to make it up?\"\"can I still pass the class?\" \"Please let me know if I need to speak to the chair regarding extensions.\"\n\n(Don't worry, I reply. \"Please see the syllabus. Please use the grading chart to see. Please feel free to talk to the chair, dean, and director\").\n\nI had a student who wanted me to open up a closed assignment because he had an incident happen to him. I also drop the lowest assignment grades btw...I told him No...then he writes in a sarcastic snarky way back about why I should reconsider and to let him \"know if \\[he\\] should talk to the chair.\"\n\nI replied back in the exact way to him (using the same salutations and such) and to told him to please talk to the following \\[names+emails\\]. Never heard back AND he never asked for extensions in the upcoming assignments. Of course, he didn't drop the class.\n\nI have several examples of this. Most definitely not reading evaluations. No fucking way.\n\nMeanwhile, I work a full-time job, I'm taking a ton of sick leave to see Drs, therapy, taking medication. So I feel like a hypocrite, but then again as a first-gen child of immigrants, I didn't get diagnosed until my mid-30s! I want to fucking cry so hard, because I felt like I could have accomplished so much if I got treated earlier. I didn't \"seem\" like I had a problem. (Not just my to my parents but to society as a female). I never got diagnosed. No one paid for me to go see a psychiatrist. I never got decent health insurance until now. I could never afford any of these things, and I literally lost over three decades of my life. It makes me livid.\n\nDidn't go to a top school, but got a PhD. But it sucked--hard. I'm still playing catch up. Thanks to my meds, I'm not as impulsive, because right now I'm dead-set on driving away to a city I always wanted to move to.\n\nI hate how I talk. I actually wanted to ask tips on this subreddit. I hear myself talk in these videos, and it's terrible. I don't edit them, because that's how I speak in-person, but, man I need help. Basically, I sound like I don't know what I'm talking about. It's bad. My writing has improved, but still needs massive work. I do well in conferences and presentations (according to people that have watched or heard me), but that's because I prep a lot. I can't do that with lectures or anything last minute. I'm definitely not very articulate. Reading doesn't help me. I'm very jealous of people, like lawyers and academics, who can speak so eloquently without scripts. I think it's badass.\n\nI try to write a script for the lectures, but I don't have time. Why? F-T job, doctor's appointments, taking care of elderly parents, grading assignments that are poor, exams, and my favorite, spending time filling out academic dishonesty forms. I'm drowning. But guess what? I grade most assignments by midterm, the modules always open on time, etc.\n\nI feel like a hypocrite, because I was nodding when I was reading the Unpopular opinion post, but then, I also had students with DRC accommodations that turned in the work on time.\n\nI'm just so fucking sick of these excuses. Also, I cannot use my disability to be behind on my work at my job or my finances. Then again, other things in my life are going on the back burner (phone calls I have to make, things I have to pay, grocery shopping, a sport I had to put on the side, etc). I'm definitely going to stop teaching after this semester, but (something else I might post about) teaching also helps me keep myself intellectually curious and helps me think of paper topics, but it's insanely time consuming as an adjunct with other work. I also have to start working on applying to jobs that will increase my income.\n\nTrying to help students,  and then they do 180 and gaslight you, because you didn't give them the answer that they ~~wanted~~ demanded  is seriously molding me into the most un-empathetic person ever.\n\nSorry, I flared it advice/support, but it's half rant too. Actually came to work on a lecture video \"script\" and just typed this essay instead. \\*huffs\\*\n\nBack to me procrastinating on this lecture video.\n\n**tl;dr** struggling instructor here with psychiatric issues sick of all the excuses. I do believe in providing support, but the gaslighting is fucked up.\n\nP.S. going through some of the comments in that post, please be careful with \"sterotyping\" how some illnesses should look like. \n\nFor example, I've had a panic attack that sent me to the ER after eating breakfast. \n\nYes, ADHD could be debilitating enough where it will lead someone not to do something that will take five minutes.  It's also not just about \"the focusing thing.\" It causes massive damage to other parts of your life, like relationships.\n\nI flew under the radar a lot, because I got a PhD. Not the top student, but occasionally busted out some decent stuff and won awards. That's something else to consider when things don't look as the seem/should/meet normative expectations\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post": "I'm wondering if anyone out there has encountered good resources to help navigate the challenges of advising/supervising relationships with graduate students. \n\nSpecifically, what I'm looking for are resources (articles, books, whatever) that deal with the *social* and *emotional* challenges of advising students and chairing dissertation committees, rather than just general guidelines or advice focused solely on the intellectual aspects of supervising research. \n\nOver the years, my unit has struggled with a fair number of dysfunctional advising relationships, and no one is really sure what to do about it. Not only does this consume a lot of time and energy, but it also damages morale and creates tremendous additional stress for our students. \n\nI should also be clear that I'm not referring to situations of harassment or outright bullying, although I know how important it is to learn how to address these situations. I'm just thinking of advisors and advisees who don't get along, or who have communication breakdowns, or who get locked into bad relationship dynamics.\n\nAlso, I want to emphasize that I'm looking specifically for resources to help *faculty* (and departments or department leaders). I see a fair amount out there (on Reddit and beyond) targeted towards students (\"how to deal with a bad supervisor,\" etc.).\n\nBut I haven't been able to find as much targeted towards faculty (\"how to run a successful prelim\" or \"how to deal with conflicts among committee members\" or \"how to work with a student struggling with mental illness  - or with procrastination, writer's block, or shyness\" or \"how to intervene in a dysfunctional advising relationship,\" etc.) or towards departments (\"how to cultivate best practices for advising,\" etc.).\n\nIt seems to me that these are really difficult tasks, and most of us don't really get any training in this, other than observing our own advisors. Also, a PhD dissertation is a relatively long-term relationship - so sometimes these dysfunctional relationships can linger for years.\n\nIf you know of helpful resources (or past threads in this subreddit), I'd be very grateful if you could share them!",

        "post": "I just got diagnosed with ADHD - Primarily Inattentive at 36.  I'm an Assistant Professor and was wondering what kind of accommodations I can ask for.   I have a private office, I set boundaries about when I am accessible / available in person and via email.  I have extensive organizational systems to try to keep on top of all the tasks required to teach and manage a course.  I have recently requested to only teach 1 prep next year.  I do not have an open door policy.  If students request things verbally, I ask them to send me a follow up email as a reminder.  I only work with one student at a time during office hours.  Teaching lab sections are overwhelming, but I am trying to put in place classroom practices to make it less so.  What am I missing?\n\nI feel like some of these things that I require to function may look bad from other faculty and students.  Like, other professors respond to emails on the weekend or have an open door policy, and by me not being available will hurt my student evaluations.  I feel like I have begrudging support from other faculty members in the department.  Like it has been suggested multiple times that having office hours on Sunday or in the evenings would help with my evals.  I've pushed back, but maybe if I had it as part of an official accommodation it would be easier?  \n\nLast, I'm pre-tenure. I don't think I need an extension, but I was wondering if there are other accommodations I could ask for in the tenure process?  \n\nAlso, it would be great to hear from other faculty who have ADHD in general.  It can be a little isolating. <3",

        "post": "This has been the worst semester I have had in almost 20 years. The writing quality was awful and on the first written assignment I caught 10% of my class (class has 140 students) either plagiarizing, using direct quotes in correctly, as in writing what you want and then putting it into direct quotes, or using AI.\n\nI teach cognitive psychology which does deal with AI so I outlined how to cite AI which includes the AI model used, what prompts were used and then AI output. Under no circumstances is AI to ever be used for the student's own writing. \n\nSo I create assignments with what I call traps. For example, if there are 7 questions, I will make sure 4 can't be answered with AI like having to cite a video. So then I have a nice writing sample comparison right in the assignment. I also use ChatGPT and created a bot, kind of a virtual TA, and fed it several hundred anonymized writing samples from previous classes so it knows what college writing looks like. In other words, it's easy to catch students. If I suspect a violation of academic integrity, I always meet with them on Zoom before I decide what's going to happen.\n\nIn the end, it took me almost 40 hours to grade 1 assignment because when I grade, I feel compelled to provide feedback on what lost them points and how to correct it.\n\nA lot of students don't follow directions, their writing quality is so much worse, and they don't understand the basics of writing in science fields.\n\nI am legit disturbed. I explained to the class that even university presidents could lose their job and career over this stuff and they are seniors at a University. After awhile it started to sink in, but it took way too much of my time and effort to get seniors in college to understand why writing properly and citing correctly is a good thing.\n\nAnd I wonder if anyone else has noticed this in their students.",

        "post": "I'm getting yelled at from multiple directions because I've procrastinated my 15 or so mandatory training modules. A couple are helpful, but many are basically corporate ass-covering (\"Information security is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY\", \"Remember that children on campus are NOT COVERED by the campus protection policy unless they are with an AUTHORIZED ACTIVITY...\"). Occasionally, whoever orders these things doesn't even check to make sure they even apply to universities (\"Job efficiency is JOB ONE for every employee, from your CEO down to the janitor\").\n\nAny tips for minimizing the time I spend doing these? I'm looking at 10-20 hours of my life every year, completely uncompensated, and I'd prefer not make it a lot less, if possible.\n\n*Edit*: Y'all are awesome. Thanks for the tips. I don't think I can be the person who farms this out to someone else (like, there is actually some helpful info in these trainings, between the corporate cruft), but some of your hints seem very useful to me.\n\n*Edit 2*: After carefully noting all the great suggestions here, I went to do my very-procrastinated trainings... and they were gone! Of course we switched to a different system last September, the third or fourth compliance training system in the past six years, and this time they apparently decided to put compliance on the calendar year rather than academic year schedule. I then got another nastygram saying I was out of compliance as of January 1. I replied that I was trying to do them, and an hour later the modules magically appeared in my compliance website \"dashboard\" again. I cracked my knuckles and prepared to follow y'all's advice, and then... every time I clicked a compliance module it glitched: a weird half-second blob of server text followed by \"This module is no longer available.\" I was a bit freaked (\"insubordination\" is one of the things you can get fired for, tenure or not, and I wondered if this counted) but then I noticed that each module was showing as \"completed.\" So I spent all of 2 minutes clicking modules, seeing \"not available,\" then seeing \"completed.\"\n\nI worry I am being [reinforced](https://y.yarn.co/728c3904-4d75-42b6-bcf6-6d21a7e1789d_text.gif) for the wrong things...",

        "post": "Hello fellow educators of r/Professors,\n\nI come to you today with a perplexing phenomenon that has been unfolding in my virtual classroom. It involves those cryptic ellipses\u2014those three little dots\u2014that students seem to wield with both cunning and curiosity.\n\nPicture this: a student submits a discussion post, and there it is\u2014a solitary period, a dot, a full stop. But wait! A few minutes later, like a digital chameleon, the post morphs. The dot vanishes, replaced by a well-crafted response. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re playing hide-and-seek with their own words.\n\n**Why, oh why, do they do this?** Here are some theories I\u2019ve concocted in my cunny-fueled musings:\n\n1. **The Sneaky Surveyors:** Perhaps these students are secret surveyors, peeking at their peers\u2019 posts before committing their own. They want to know what\u2019s out there, like cautious explorers venturing into the academic wilderness.\n2. **The Time Travelers:** Could it be that they\u2019re bending the space-time continuum? Post first, edit later\u2014because who wouldn\u2019t want to impress their classmates with a response from the future? \u201cBehold, my eloquence transcends mere linear time!\u201d\n3. **The Deadline Dancers:** Ah, the thrill of procrastination! Picture this: 11:59 PM\u2014the witching hour. A lone dot appears. Then, like Cinderella\u2019s carriage, a fully formed post emerges at 1:20 AM. It\u2019s like they\u2019re racing against the clock, fueled by adrenaline and the promise of a grade.\n4. **The Formatting Fanatics:** Maybe they\u2019re perfectionists, fretting over font size, paragraph breaks, and MLA citations. They want their posts to shimmer like freshly polished apples. So, they peek, they tweak, and they emerge with posts worthy of a typographical symphony.\n5. **The Cunny Copycat:** Imagine a student reading a brilliant post, eyes wide with admiration. \u201cI must channel this genius!\u201d they declare. And so, they edit\u2014transforming their dot into a mirror reflecting someone else\u2019s brilliance.\n\nNow, dear colleagues, how do we respond? Should we embrace the ellipses, allowing this digital dance to continue? Or should we lock down the edit button, thwarting their temporal escapades?\n\nShare your wisdom, your tales, and your best eye-roll moments. Let\u2019s unravel the mystery of the dot-dot-dots together!\n\n*P.S. To the student who once submitted a dot at 11:59 PM and a masterpiece at 1:20 AM: You\u2019ve left your mark on the annals of academia. Bravo.*",

        "post": "Is it appropriate to play J.K. Rowling speeches in class?  I don't know what to do with cancel culture...\n\nI'm teaching a unit on narrative style to a class of first-years.  I've used an assignment for the past few years in which students choose between 4 TED Talks to write on how the speaker uses narrative style to get their message across to a professional/potentially academic audience.  This worked great virtually because students could just choose one video that interests them and essentially ignore the rest.  Now that we're back in the classroom, I decided to play all four videos during class for exposure and then let them decide which they want to write about.   The second video I played was a short talk by a trans activist, Samy Nour Younes, titled \"A Short History of Trans People's Long Fight for Equality.\" The fourth video was J.K. Rowling's 2008 Harvard commencement speech on \"The Fringe Benefits of Failure,\" which, despite Rowling's cultural crimes, still has such a valuable message for first-years on how to look differently at failure. (For context, the other two videos were \"Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator\" by Tim Urban and \"3 Ways to Speak English\" by Jamila Lyiscott)\n\nI prefaced the Rowling speech with a disclaimer on what I wrote above, that despite her crimes, the message in this 2008 speech is still worthwhile, but that if it doesn't feel comfortable for anyone, they are welcome to take care of themselves and leave class early and to choose a different speaker to write about.  Before I could get through my disclaimer, a student raised their hand and denounced that it \"wasn't cool\" to play Rowling after the previous video.  I thanked the student for their perspective and repeated my disclaimer, then began the video.\n\nThe student stayed, but typed vigorously on their phone through the video.  I felt a twinge of regret in playing the video because it's important to me that students feel safe, heard, and welcomed in my class.  But, I also wasn't prepared, nor did I feel it worthwhile at this point in the semester (it's our first week back on campus after 2 weeks virtual) to engage in a potentially long class-wide dialogue on cancel culture -- this can perhaps come at a later date, but right now, I need to meet some course outcomes.  I did state, in a welcoming tone, at the end of class that I'd be in my office if anyone wanted to discuss my choice of videos; the student did not do so.\n\nBut, this experience has prompted me to wonder how we approach potentially troublesome authors, researchers, and/or material within academia without laborious convos about cancel culture - do we give a brief statement and move forward (in my case, keeping the Rowling speech in as part of the course), or do we remove the trouble, ascribing to cancel culture (in my case, deleting the Rowling speech from future classes, despite its useful message)?  Would you recommend I reach out to the concerned student or give the student space in the next class to discuss their concern?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: After thinking about my post and reading some responses, I want to clarify my question: it  isn't about whether it's okay to show controversial material in class, it's about how to approach material by an author or researcher who has known lack of sensitivity toward a particular group of  humans' real lived experiences and perspectives.\n\nI appreciate the perspectives on the use of the term \"cancel culture\" as perpetuating it; I hadn't thought of that but was using language I figured students would understand.

        "post": "I teach at a fairly large public D1 University and teach in sport and health sciences. A growing trend, but really worse this spring is students aren't reading or won't read the book. I have received some class feedback what their main barriers are to doing well on quizzes or in class. Here's the most mentioned: too many courses/course work, unable to recall/comprehend the book,  wanting quizzes after the lecture to use notes, And lastly, not having to identify the specific correct answers (???)\n\nHere is what I provide to them every week: a study guide (where if they fill it out when they read they will have all the answers to the quiz questions each week). The idea is if they do this they come to class prepared to discuss the material and have a pretty easy decent grade on a quiz. Additionally, all quizzes are multiple choice and true and false. \n\nI understand that trying to get students to read is kind of a fools errand these days, but I wanted to throw the question out there to see what approach I can take going forward in class and what advice I might be able to give to my students. I feel they are beginning to take advantage of me and trying to get the class to be as easy as possible with as little work as possible. \n\nI have already done lectures on time management, planning, procrastination, and even crisis management, of which I try to relate not only from what we're there to study but also to their own lives right now, but generally seems to fly over their heads. So I'm not really sure where to go from here. Thanks in advance for any advice.",

They didn\u2019t follow any directions. I submitted grades last night. I did respond to their email and say I would regrade it if they redid it that night. This morning I responded to an email from them asking for other very insignificant grades to be regraded and questions about the paper. I explained the paper grade and immediately got a reply that they resubmitted it this morning. To avoid any confrontation I was going to look at it and maybe change the grade. It was still totally fucking wrong. Did not follow directions. Not even formatting directions. I don\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t even respond and I\u2019m not going to.

        "post": "There have been a few threads recently about (seemingly mostly failed) flexible deadline experiments. I had similar experiences with a particular category of assignment in my classes last year. Unsurprisingly, my strategy of taking two minutes out of every class to *plead* with them to get it done early twice a week for nearly three months didn't work. However, the objectives and spirit of the assignment necessitate that students be able to choose which weekly topic they want to write about. Rather than getting rid of the flexible deadline entirely, this upcoming semester I'm thinking of having them do a planning activity at the beginning of the semester, requiring them to set their own deadlines. These deadlines won't be enforced, but I'm hoping that it will at least make some dent in the proportion of students who wait until (after the) very last minute.\n\nThe learning experts all say that explaining the rationale for a given item of teaching can be helpful, so I'm trying to come up with a script for my TAs or a Youtube video or something that will impress upon students the importance of planning and the evils of procrastination in way that actually (somewhat) registers. I'm here soliciting recommendations for resources, information, or strategies that you have used to at least moderate effect? Thank you!",

        "post": "I'm an adjunct professor in an IT course that is taught online. Each semester, there are lab assignments that can be challenging and it's not unusual to set up several Zoom meetings with students to help them troubleshoot.\n\nIn the many years I've been teaching this course, there are always several students who wait until 2 hours before the due date (midnight, end of week) to get started, hit a wall, and then e-mail me pleading for help. When I was new, I would stay up to help them. I'd be having Zoom calls or exchanging e-mails at 11 PM.\n\nI eventually got tired of staying up late, sacrificing sleep or time with family/friends to help students who were clearly not taking ownership of their education. I began making it clear in the syllabus and class announcements, in bold, red text: Labs should be started when they are assigned to allow plenty of time for troubleshooting before the due date. The professor is not available late at night to answer last minute inquiries. Late submissions receive a zero. I also make this clear in the video lectures where I walk through the lab with a screen recording, step by step.\n\nDespite all of these warnings, there are still always a small handful of students who wait until the last minute, and I enforce the policy. They get a zero and a reminder about all the warnings that were given. They usually don't make the mistake again, but it still makes a B the best mathematically possible grade they can get - it's a hard lesson.\n\nThis semester, *more than half* of my students waited until the last minute and didn't turn anything in. I just doled out *a dozen* zeroes. Normally I don't lose much sleep over this policy, but when it's the *majority* of students, I have to wonder... what else can I do? How can I make it more clear that they have a week to work on this assignment and can't start it at the last minute and still expect credit?",

I sometimes go to one or the other to work when I get tired of sitting in my office.  \n\nNow I've noticed that at one library I have to open  my backpack and show the security guard its contents only when I enter, but at the other library I only have to show my bag when I leave.  As I check in, find a table, and get seated, I'm often left pondering why this is.  \n\nPerhaps library 1 has lots of things that are valuable but not easily vulnerable to theft (e. g.  nice tables, murals, etc.) so they are most concerned about me bringing food/drink/spray paint etc.  that might be a danger to those things.  Whereas library 2 may have more stealable things (books, rare collections) so theft is the main concern there.  \n\nThe odd thing is that library 2, but not library 1, has an RF tag system at the exit that will beep if you pass through with a book.  So screening at exit is redundant as far as books are concerned. \n\nAnd why not check at both entry and exit?  Both libraries have 3 security guards at the entrance, of whom 2 don't seem to be doing anything.  \n\nHow does it work at your library?  \n\nIn case you're wondering, yes this post is a form of procrastination to avoid grading.

        "post": "A low stakes question for the forum that I am absolutely using to procrastinate proofreading my article proofs this morning.\n\nOver the years I have accumulated a fairly large library of digital resources - articles, ebooks, scanned primary sources like censuses and excavation notes, unpublished materials like curator reports... about 15.5 gigs at current count. Many of them are actually sources I use regularly, and some of them are things I'll never be able to get my hands on again if I nuke them now, so firebombing the directory from orbit is, while tempting, not a reasonable solution.\n\nAnd yes, there are absolutely duplicates in there which I'm slowly weeding out. My tendency to go find another copy of an article and download it again rather than sift through my own library is what proved that it's beyond time for a big cleanup.\n\nThey're semi-organized by subject at the moment, but my folders are haphazard at best and there's often overlap between the categories; they grew organically, but it now makes it tricky to figure out where to file something. (Is this material culture, or is it Atlantic history - it's both, so where do I stick it...) And I've still got some project-specific folders like \"Post-doc secondary sources articles\" to break apart and refile.\n\nRight now I'm using astrogrep to find things, since it lets me search the body of documents for text strings, but that relies on me remembering a quote or title correctly, and takes too long.\n\nSo here's the question for y'all - **how do you organize your digital hoarding piles**? I definitely need to take some time and rename the endless GHGLLG13321.28324.BLAHBLAH.pdf filenames into author\\_title.pdf, but what about the sorting itself? Library of Congress subject headers for folders? Dewey decimal? What are your tricks for keeping this stuff manageable?\n\nEdited to add: I'm a Windows user, so Mac-only software solutions are unfortunately not going to work.",

I have two students who turned in final exams with identical answers. I would say 95% of their answers are identical. 11 of 13 answers are word for word. Even down to spelling mistakes and odd phrasing. The wording is so exact on so many questions that I don't believe it's possible for one student to have occasionally glanced at the other student's paper to copy.\n\nI believe they both cheated.\n\nI actually have no idea how they pulled it off. I can't recall where everyone was sitting in the room during the exam. I believe one student was sitting at a table behind the other. It's 98 students in a big room with only me to watch them, but they were pretty spread out. I doubt they had a copy of the exam early. These are not recycled questions, and the exam basically didn't exist until the night before the final (because I procrastinate like that). Some of the handwriting on the two is suspiciously similar, but also looks different in other places, and like each student's handwriting on previous exams. I can't tell\u2014I'm no handwriting expert. Though sometimes I wish I was...\n\nI think the most likely explanation is that one student wrote both exams. But then why copy the answers exactly? Maybe one finished early and handed theirs to the other student to copy? I don't know. My institution tends to give students a ton of chances, and I basically have to go in with absolute proof to make any impact.\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "post": "This is a question that I've been kicking around since starting to procrastinate on last semester's grading. The flipped classroom basically says to put the main instruction part of the course at home, and have more homework type work take place in class.\n\nThe typical literature course involves students reading at home, and then engaging in discussions about interpretation, theme, etc, all the nuances of the work, in class. That sounds like a flipped classroom to me, even though it's also the tradition way these classes are taught.\n\nLet me try to explain this by unflipping the lit course, bring the homework to class, send the classwork home.\n\nYou'd come into class, and the professor would walk you through the text, explaining all the events and characters, and probably reading a lot of whole passages. Then, you'd be given a homework assignment to write a short essay analyzing the story. That seems to fit the normal \"unflipped\" model by placing the primary instruction (reading the text) in the classroom.\n\nBut, probably due mostly to time constraints, lit classes have already moved the primary part of instruction to home. In class, you'll typically have a discussion that looks a lot like basically figuring out an essay.\n\nAm I totally off base here? Am I missing something?\n\n[Note I'm not saying all courses with reading at home are inherently flipped. I think literature is unique in that students are expected to not just read at home, but to get a certain level of competence with the material on their own. The basics of the texts might never be explicitly stated in a class lecture. Very different from reading before having the same material largely repeated in a lecture.]",

I started to struggle with this before the pandemic hit, putting things off until the last minute or missing deadlines entirely, and I am having worse problems with time management now. \n\nIn the past, everything had a deadline that was controlled by others. Even the push for tenure involved a ticking clock. Now, the flexibility of my days is killing productivity and I can't snap out of it. Even though I have a lot to do, I sleep in until 10:00, watch three hours of Netflix, grade just enough to get students off my back, and then I'm tired and tell myself I will get back to that paper tomorrow--but the next day I do the exact same thing. I had a new prep this semester, and I put off getting ready for the class all winter break, even though I really wasn't doing anything else. I'm now just 12 hours ahead of students in terms of preparing for the class. It's awful.\n\nThe thing is, I really like my job. I teach interesting classes, and I am very interested in my research. But, it seems to take me 8 hours to finish things that should take 2 hours. When I'm at work, I socialize and tell myself that I will attend to necessary tasks when I'm home. When I'm home, my days are unstructured, and no matter how much I tell myself I'm going to stick to a schedule, I can't stick to it. \n\nI don't know if I am maybe suffering from depression (I have no motivation), or if I just never learned time management and I'm simply a horrible self starter. It is starting to hurt my career, but even knowing this, I repeat the same pattern of nothingness every day. \n\nAnyone else out there ever gone through something like this? If I hated my classes or didn't enjoy doing research, I would say it is job burnout or disappointment in the job itself, but those things aren't true. What is true is that I can outline project after project, download everything I need for the literature review, get everything set up and even start collecting data--but then I find something else that is just as interesting and I bounce to that topic. I am finishing nothing. I don't know what is wrong with me and I need advice. ",

        "post": "Cute alliteration aside, I think that my diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety is being made worse by the pandemic. In pre-pandemic times, it was often extremely difficult to start new tasks, whether it be grading, writing exams, working on the nominal amount of research I have to do to appease the school's accreditation body, or or doing lecture videos for my online classes. I procrastinated on almost everything. But I somehow got enough work done to be somewhat functional as an instructor because doing something productive would take away the guilt I felt about not working and make me hate myself just a little bit less. \n\nIn other words, for almost all of my career (beginning in grad school and now a NTT full-time instructor), my motivation to do most of my work has been to feel \"less bad\",  less guilty, rather than to feel a sense of accomplishment. But now, I'm pretty minimally functional. I'm working from home for safety and I have a little work area setup in my dining room (I don't have room for a proper office). It's mostly free of distractions, but now my procrastination is worse. Everytims I even think about working, I get waves of anxiety that make me want to just sit on the couch and surf reddit on my phone. \n\nThen emails come in from students wondering about when the next quiz or video will be posted (I change stuff each year to prevent cheating, and some videos are just outdated). I can feel my heart rate increase when I see these emails and I feel stupid because if I didn't procrastinate, this wouldn't happen. So then I feel yet more anxiety and guilt than makes it harder to actually get work done.\n\nAdd to this my depression that says nothing I have to teach is important and that teaching during these times is like polishing banisters on the Titanic. It's getting even harder to do things. I can post PowerPoints but the thought of doing recorded lectures fills me with dread, *even though I've been recording lectures for years for my classes.* I have trouble keeping up with my own syllabus schedule because I'm not releasing assignments on time, which makes it so that I have to extend my own deadlines in order to be fair to the class.\n\nI am on medication for depression and see a therapist. I guess I'm better off with them than without, but I don't feel like they help much. There are occasional good days where I am productive, but a lot of the time, I just want to give up.\n\nIs anyone else feeling something like this?",

        "post": "Prior to the pandemic, it was (seemingly) considered a reasonable accommodation to allow a students who missed an exam to make it up in person, in my office. It was also considered reasonable to require that missed assignments, quizzes, and exams be made up within a few days or by the end of the week. \n\nBut now, post-pandemic, it seems as though many students find these requirements unreasonable given that the technology clearly exists for them to complete almost any assignment (exams included) online, and assessments/assignments can easily be \"re-opened\" for them at a later date. And in once sense I get it - administrators encouraged/required us to provide loooooong grace periods for students who contracted COVID, allowing them to make up assignments sometimes weeks later. And completing a missed assessment online is certainly easier than trekking to a professor's office to do it in person. But on the other hand, allowing students to make up exams online essentially turns them into open-note, open-book exams, and this is undermines the assessment while being unfair to the other students in the course. And allowing open-ended deadlines on making up assignments often results in students procrastinating too long and then giving up on catching up (often resulting in a snow-ball effect, especially in an online course).\n\nThe issue is that when a student emails me about missing an assignment or exam, they often open by asking \"can I complete it online?\" and often also expect an unlimited timeframe for doing so. When I respond that they \"need to complete it in my office\" or that they have \"until Friday\" to submit something, I'm usually met with silence and a missed deadline. \n\nIs this because students think these formerly acceptable accommodations are unreasonable in post-pandemic academia? Should I take time to carefully explain my reasoning, rather than simply letting them know how/when something can be made up? But saying \"you can't take the exam from home because then you might use your notes/book\" doesn't seem like a good solution either. Appropriately accommodating students really feels like a no-win situation sometimes, and I'm struggling with how to best approach these situations in an ever-changing educational landscape.\n\n(Relatedly, I'd also love to hear any thoughts on a professor's obligation to reach out to students who have stopped engaging in a course.)",

        "post": "For the first time possibly ever, I'm not looking forward to classes starting.   In fact I'm dreading it. I love teaching college students.  It is frustrating and sometimes I fail, but overall teaching is the best part of my job and I love seeing young minds turn on to my subject or solve analytic problems.\n\n  \nBut I just can't get up the enthusiasm.  I'm teaching two hybrid courses (each with a small in-person component) and one online course and there are so many reasons I'm dreading it:\n\n1 - I'm way behind on prep.  This is a combination of anxiety-induced procrastination and the fact that, while I've taught all three of the courses, they're basically all new preps with the change in format.\n\n2 - I don't love online teaching in general.  It feels cold and impersonal and emphasizes the parts of my teaching that are the weakest, while de-emphasizing the stuff that I'm good at.\n\n3 - I'm worried that the small in-person teaching parts are going to give someone COVID.\n\n4 - I'm worried that my students will have many additional barriers to success this semester.  My students have plenty to begin with because of the student population, and the pandemic doesn't help. If last spring was any indicator, this semester will be hard on them.\n\n5 - General pandemic-induced dread/isolation.\n\n  \nAnyone else feeling this way?  I feel like I'm walking into the crater of an active volcano.",

I'm a 'hard professor' and Im okay with that. But everyone kept complaining and complaining, and I started to doubt myself, and got easier on the students, trying to not be hard, and to be nicer... and then all the students just quit working. \n\n\\-\n\nShould have stayed hard. About 4-5 weeks ago, attendance started to plummet. work started to plummet. attitudes started to plummet. and now here we are today. Final project is due in 7 days. It's a BIG project. We have two guest reviewers coming in, one flying in on their own expense, to review the projects. It's a big deal. As of monday, 50% of the class **hadn't even started.** Class is three hours long (i'm in the arts)  and Monday was litterally just me staring at a room of students (half of which were missing all together) while they STARTED to work on their projects. There was nothing for me to do but just wait out the clock. I coundn't even give feedback because so few had anything to show. And I've been on them -gently- for weeks. Trying not to be the 'hard professor'. You should really work on this. You are behind have you thought about coming to office hours, are you okay, email me with any questions, you seem really behind... fucking *nothing*. \n\n\\-\n\nSo today, i rage quit. for the day. emailed the class that class was canceled today. Honestly, im embarrassed for the guest reviewers to come, and if they hadn't already purchased airfare on their own dime i would cancel. I went on a mad dad email about how disappointed i was and broke down what was due when (there is a calendar that's been publicly available for weeks) and what percentage of the class was on top of shit. (roughly 6 out of 24 of them). no class. Not going to stare at the clock for 3 hours because there is nothing discuss and you haven't started a 4 week project that's due in 7 days. Told them I would be available during class time for 1-on-1 feedback for their projects, in any state. should they need. \n\n\\-\n\ntwo took me up on that offer. two, that of course are doing absolutely fine and have been more or less on top of shit the whole time. The ones that are drowning are still evidently oblivious to their impending doom.\n\n\\-\n\nI don't know if me trying to be the 'not hard professor' fucked the class. or its pandemic related, or somehow i just became immediately unlikable when i showed my belly or what. but this fucking class went WAY off the rails, and I can not wait for next week (Finals week) to be over. This is my 10th year of being a professor, and this is the second worst class i've ever had.",

But this semester, I'm struggling. \n\nI know what I have to do, and can do. I'm in charge of the course, so I make up the case assignments that I'm now complaining about having to grade.

        "post": "I've been interested in reading so many posters here note the same trend about the grade distribution becoming more bimodal with recent cohorts of students, so I decided to look at the scores from my classes pre-COVID, with COVID restrictions, and since COVID restrictions ending at my school. \n\nI teach (in additional to upper-level courses) multiple sections of a 200 level course in the fall semester that gets mostly sophomores and juniors, as well as the occassional above average freshman and procrastinating senior. My grading scheme, assignments, and exams have been basically unchanged over the past 5 years in this particular course, so the points based score (as opposed to the final curved letter grade) should be comparable over time.\n\nPre-COVID: The most common point score was in the B range [80 - 89.99], then As and Cs were about equally common, and there was a small tail of just under 10% Ds and Fs.\n\nYear with COVID restrictions {Fall 2020} (my school had masking, socially distanced classrooms, and quarantining for exposed students/faculty, with the expectation of simultaneous streaming for students who could not come to class): A grades drop sharpest, followed by Bs and Cs, with a big movement of mass to the D/F group. [Not a shock].\n\nNo major COVID restrictions {Fall 21 and 22}: A grades return almost to normal, but B grades fall even further. The mass that used to be in the B group pre-COVID gets spread pretty evenly over the Cs and the Ds. D/Fs are almost twice as frequent as they were pre-COVID.\n\nBefore starting this analysis, I wasn't sure if I agreed with the many posters about the change to a more bimodal distribution. I think some of the institutional characteristics of my school and the type of students we attract resist some of that shift. I really didn't see much of an increase in students quitting on the course (either by withdrawing or getting Fs by not doing assignments/tests). But even so, I'm seeing basically 15% of my students go from A/B to C/D grades.",

I have a manuscript I never published due to jumping into work at a CC and doing abundant COVID work (public health). \n\nLong story short: While in my program, I was published but never given the chance to work on a single manuscript. I did intervention-based research and we had 2 publications from it. \n\nI have a qualitative manuscript that is mostly done but have been anxious to try to get it published. My dissertation got rave reviews both inside and outside my institution. I was cited in a pretty famous book from my dissertation.\n\nSo what's the issue? I don't know how to get published myself. What I've done is created a mostly-done manuscript based off of what I see in the journal I want to publish in. I've reviewed their formatting instructions which are a bit bonkers (so many odd indentions, styling, etc.) but doing my best. \n\nAny advice? Once I'm done, do I just submit? Do I pay IF it's accepted? The journal I'm interested in has low acceptance even though it's a match and I've worked with the editor before. \n\nAny tips/advice would be great. I am so far out of the data (conducted in 2018) that I'm almost certain it won't get published anyway. I've been procrastinating mostly due to work but also due to fear. Thank you for reading this!",

        "post": "I admit a post on different due dates reminded me I wanted to ask this.\n\nI teach a 1 credit, relatively easy, required introductory freshman course. It's straightforward: 10 assignments, 2 exams (midterm and final). The dues dates are published on the LMS schedule before the semester starts.\n\nI warn students that the grade distribution is an upside down bell curve, As on one end, and Ds and Es on the other, with few grades in between. The difference is late penalties -- as soon as students get behind and start accruing late penalties, they can't recover. I tell them the difference is time management -- don't procrastinate. I do offer leniency, with a set number of late days that can be redeemed, no questions asked, to remove late penalties\n\nIn my ratings (and in a few demanding emails) this last semester I got complaints about the dues dates and late penalties. In all the years I've taught this class, no one has ever complained about these. One was a long rant about how late penalties are unfair and they don't reflect a students' true performance. Just stuff like that -- if they do the work, they should receive the grade they *deserve,* not have late penalties keep them from an A; they are being discriminated against and it's hurting their GPA. I've been overly lenient with Covid and was surprised by the complaining, and honestly, complaints in general have gone up. Like I am teaching mini cranky Karens. The average class GPA was 3.7!\n\nI thought university students understood that assignments have due dates, and professors can choose to not accept late work or add late penalties. Since I figure I'm these freshmans' orientation to university life. I'm considering adding a short section in my syllabus on why I have due dates and late penalties (my freshman syllabi are super detailed, while my upper-level classes are one page).\n\nI feel stupid for asking this, as I would never think to ask this a few years ago, but do any of you include the purpose of due dates and late penalties in your syllabi?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: wow. I posted this morning because I was a irritated by the students and didn't expect it to take off. I'm going to add an explanation in the FAQs. I teach about 1000 students in the combined sections and do everything I can to reduce email. I also have learned that I need a bulletproof syllabus in this class because students love to find loopholes and demand extra. I do know the problem ones don't listen in class and don't read the syllabus, but sometimes I cut and paste from the syllabus because I get tired of 100 emails about the same issue.   \n\n\nI also learned maybe I should avoid professor TikTok.

        "post": "Hi all,\n\nAs I finished marking exams and am now procrastinating on some committee work I thought I would post a thought piece to generate some discussion.\n\nTo a large degree traditional Universities still operate in Semesters. There are generally 2 or 3 in a year. In each Semesters students complete 3 or 4 courses. As the Mandalorian may say 'This is the way'. The only real difference to the way Universities teach (not including Admin mandated changes to standards, marking, student interaction or economic cuts) was imposed by COVID.   \n\nWhat I am thinking is that degrees need to be made up lots more smaller courses, or more intense courses. Some option I would float are\n\n* Rather than doing 4 courses concurrently  across a 13 week semester, complete two subjects in an intense 6 week block, and then complete the other two in another 6 week block or \n* Break down a full 13 week courses into two six week courses. Why? \n\n1. Students who fail a course can't continue to the next course. You can think of it as scaffolding with consequences if you like. Students are therefore  'forced' to review material more regularly. \n2. The same concept is often taught in multiple courses. This would be a way to consolidate these courses.\n3. It's easier to offer the same course multiple times per year. If a student does fail a course, they do not need to wait for a year to retake the course.   \n4. It could be easier to describe exactly what a course covers and what a student is expected to know or be able to do. You could think of describing courses and outcomes in terms of competency statements.\n5. One assessment piece for each course. \n\n* For T&R academics there is a possibility of squeezing their teaching responsibilities into condensed blocks of time, leaving time for actual research.\n* It could be easier to update or introduce new courses. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;",

I have been teaching online the last two semesters (COVID), but I have a set class time. Last semester I gave my exams during my class time, but there were some technical issues. (Thank you, Blackboard.) This semester, I decided to extend it to two days open rather than having everyone logged in at the same time. It was open from before class time on Monday until Tuesday at 5pm. Not only did I give them two days, I gave them multiple attempts. \n\nThen I got this email from a student today (Wednesday), after the deadline was over. The student hasn't contacted me all semester, much less to voice any concern about the format of the class or that they were having problems. All of my assignments are due at 5pm on the due date so I can finalize grading in the evening, but they're all open for a week or more before that deadline. I assume it goes without saying, but I'll mention that they are open 24 hours a day when they're open, except for the day they're due. \n\nI'll paraphrase to avoid identifiable bits, and to make it more grammatically sound.\n\n\"Professor, I want you to reopen the midterm exam for me. I had class on Tuesday morning and then I had to work until the evening. So I had no time for the exam. Apparently you have no heart, and you don't understand that students have obligations outside of school, or you would change the deadlines. The deadline of 5pm is ridiculous! It's affecting my grade! I can't do assignments because I'm at work past 5pm. You should take this into account and change the deadlines so that it's more convenient for me.\"\n\nI literally went cross-eyed reading this letter. WTF? I always get a few students who miss exams (inevitable with 200 students), but they're usually remorseful about missing and take responsibility for it. I don't think I've ever had someone just completely miss the exam and put the blame on me. And I don't even know what this student is talking about, since it was open all day Monday, too. \n\nWhat's more, I'd made them fill out an acknowledgment last week that included the times the midterm was open, basically agreeing that they were okay with this arrangement. I had even said I would work around student schedules, since I do know a lot of my students have other obligations. In fact, I'm back in graduate school myself, getting my ass kicked working and going to school myself. And I'm more lenient than normal because...COVID. \n\nWhat's saddest, I almost always open exams back up for students if they take responsibility for their actions and have a compelling reason for missing. But not in this case. If this student had just been honest and admitted they forgot or procrastinated because they have a lot going on, I probably would have let them take it for partial credit.",

So we are actively increasing anxiety by giving extensions.  \n\nSo when do we put it back on the student to drop a course rather than bend over backwards and into pretzels handing out extensions?

        "post": "So there's this AI program that can write decent responses when given a prompt. Source: [see here](https://beta.openai.com/playground?fbclid=IwAR2hfhMg05x2do1xJhYefMm63F5UvJUnvEFbD-cpRmE_coByiXtgsoiMCPw).  It seems like it could be used as an easy way to start a paper, and could present an issue for academic integrity, making it virtually undetectable when people plagiarize from an AI.\n\n It does not give the same answer if you give it the same prompt, instead appears quite flexible.  For example I gave it the prompt  \"Discuss the role of religion in Victorian England\" and it came back with \"The Victorian era was a time of great change in the country, and religious beliefs were a major factor in this change. The Church of England was the dominant religion in the country, and its influence was felt in all aspects of society. The Victorian era was also a time of great industrialization, and the rise of the middle class. This led to a change in the social hierarchy, and the Church of England began to lose its grip on power. The middle class began to challenge the Church's authority, and this led to a decline in its influence.\"  I deleted the response and asked it again and it said: \"In Victorian England, religion was a very important part of people's lives. Many people were members of the Church of England, and attendance at church was mandatory. The church was very involved in people's lives, and religious leaders were often consulted on important matters.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI proceeded to give it the \"Colbert Questionnert\" as prompts, and it gave the the following interview: \n\nQ: What is the best sandwich? AI: The best sandwich is the one that you like the most.\n\nQ: What is the scariest animal?  AI: There is no definitive answer to this question as different people are afraid of different animals. Some people may find spiders or snakes to be the scariest, while others may find sharks or bears to be more intimidating.\n\nQ: Apples or oranges?  AI: I prefer apples because they are sweeter and have a softer texture.\n\nQ: Have you ever asked someone for their autograph?  AI: Yes, I have asked people for their autographs. I have asked for the autographs of athletes, musicians, and actors.\n\nQ: What do you think happens when we die?  AI: Some people believe that when we die, we go to a better place where we will be reunited with our loved ones. Other people believe that our soul is recycled and we are reborn into another person or animal.\n\nQ: What is your Favorite action movie?  AI: My favorite action movie is The Bourne Identity. I love the Bourne movies because they are intense and thrilling. They are also clever and well-made. The Bourne Identity is my favorite because it is the first movie in the series and it sets the stage for the rest of the movies.\n\nQ: Favorite smell?  AI: I love the smell of lavender.\n\nQ: Least favorite smell?  AI: My least favorite smell is the smell of rotting food.\n\nQ: Exercise: worth it?  AI: The benefits of exercise far outweigh the costs. Exercise improves mental health, increases lifespan and protects against  obesity, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and memory decline.\n\nQ: Flat or sparkling? AI: I prefer sparkling water because it is refreshing and has a pleasant taste.\n\nQ: Most used app on your phone?  AI:  My most used app on my phone is probably Instagram.\n\nQ: You get one song to listen to for the rest of your life: what is it? AI: Livin' on a Prayer by Bon Jovi\n\nQ: What number am I thinking of?  AI: 26\n\nQ: Describe the rest of your life in 5 words  AI: Happily ever after with family\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway. I played with it for awhile, procrastinating. After a few interesting responses  I prompted it with: \"You are actually the best AI I've ever seen, you legit pass the Turing test\"\n\nIt said: Thank you for your compliment!",

        "post": "Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite. I have ADHD, plus major depressive disorder and anxiety.\n\nI had a student who would not leave me alone about opening assignments that already closed using their disabilities as an excuse, but they never reached out to the disability center until the last possible minute. I repeatedly told them time and time again to do this. Said student is super clingy, constantly emailing me every week, talking to me about their disability.\n\nThis semester is hell. Half the class has Fs--like, 0%...10% etc. \"What can I do to make it up?\"\"can I still pass the class?\" \"Please let me know if I need to speak to the chair regarding extensions.\"\n\n(Don't worry, I reply. \"Please see the syllabus. Please use the grading chart to see. Please feel free to talk to the chair, dean, and director\").\n\nI had a student who wanted me to open up a closed assignment because he had an incident happen to him. I also drop the lowest assignment grades btw...I told him No...then he writes in a sarcastic snarky way back about why I should reconsider and to let him \"know if \\[he\\] should talk to the chair.\"\n\nI replied back in the exact way to him (using the same salutations and such) and to told him to please talk to the following \\[names+emails\\]. Never heard back AND he never asked for extensions in the upcoming assignments. Of course, he didn't drop the class.\n\nI have several examples of this. Most definitely not reading evaluations. No fucking way.\n\nMeanwhile, I work a full-time job, I'm taking a ton of sick leave to see Drs, therapy, taking medication. So I feel like a hypocrite, but then again as a first-gen child of immigrants, I didn't get diagnosed until my mid-30s! I want to fucking cry so hard, because I felt like I could have accomplished so much if I got treated earlier. I didn't \"seem\" like I had a problem. (Not just my to my parents but to society as a female). I never got diagnosed. No one paid for me to go see a psychiatrist. I never got decent health insurance until now. I could never afford any of these things, and I literally lost over three decades of my life. It makes me livid.\n\nDidn't go to a top school, but got a PhD. But it sucked--hard. I'm still playing catch up. Thanks to my meds, I'm not as impulsive, because right now I'm dead-set on driving away to a city I always wanted to move to.\n\nI hate how I talk. I actually wanted to ask tips on this subreddit. I hear myself talk in these videos, and it's terrible. I don't edit them, because that's how I speak in-person, but, man I need help. Basically, I sound like I don't know what I'm talking about. It's bad. My writing has improved, but still needs massive work. I do well in conferences and presentations (according to people that have watched or heard me), but that's because I prep a lot. I can't do that with lectures or anything last minute. I'm definitely not very articulate. Reading doesn't help me. I'm very jealous of people, like lawyers and academics, who can speak so eloquently without scripts. I think it's badass.\n\nI try to write a script for the lectures, but I don't have time. Why? F-T job, doctor's appointments, taking care of elderly parents, grading assignments that are poor, exams, and my favorite, spending time filling out academic dishonesty forms. I'm drowning. But guess what? I grade most assignments by midterm, the modules always open on time, etc.\n\nI feel like a hypocrite, because I was nodding when I was reading the Unpopular opinion post, but then, I also had students with DRC accommodations that turned in the work on time.\n\nI'm just so fucking sick of these excuses. Also, I cannot use my disability to be behind on my work at my job or my finances. Then again, other things in my life are going on the back burner (phone calls I have to make, things I have to pay, grocery shopping, a sport I had to put on the side, etc). I'm definitely going to stop teaching after this semester, but (something else I might post about) teaching also helps me keep myself intellectually curious and helps me think of paper topics, but it's insanely time consuming as an adjunct with other work. I also have to start working on applying to jobs that will increase my income.\n\nTrying to help students,  and then they do 180 and gaslight you, because you didn't give them the answer that they ~~wanted~~ demanded  is seriously molding me into the most un-empathetic person ever.\n\nSorry, I flared it advice/support, but it's half rant too. Actually came to work on a lecture video \"script\" and just typed this essay instead. \\*huffs\\*\n\nBack to me procrastinating on this lecture video.\n\n**tl;dr** struggling instructor here with psychiatric issues sick of all the excuses. I do believe in providing support, but the gaslighting is fucked up.\n\nP.S. going through some of the comments in that post, please be careful with \"sterotyping\" how some illnesses should look like. \n\nFor example, I've had a panic attack that sent me to the ER after eating breakfast. \n\nYes, ADHD could be debilitating enough where it will lead someone not to do something that will take five minutes.  It's also not just about \"the focusing thing.\" It causes massive damage to other parts of your life, like relationships.\n\nI flew under the radar a lot, because I got a PhD. Not the top student, but occasionally busted out some decent stuff and won awards. That's something else to consider when things don't look as the seem/should/meet normative expectations\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post": "I'm wondering if anyone out there has encountered good resources to help navigate the challenges of advising/supervising relationships with graduate students. \n\nSpecifically, what I'm looking for are resources (articles, books, whatever) that deal with the *social* and *emotional* challenges of advising students and chairing dissertation committees, rather than just general guidelines or advice focused solely on the intellectual aspects of supervising research. \n\nOver the years, my unit has struggled with a fair number of dysfunctional advising relationships, and no one is really sure what to do about it. Not only does this consume a lot of time and energy, but it also damages morale and creates tremendous additional stress for our students. \n\nI should also be clear that I'm not referring to situations of harassment or outright bullying, although I know how important it is to learn how to address these situations. I'm just thinking of advisors and advisees who don't get along, or who have communication breakdowns, or who get locked into bad relationship dynamics.\n\nAlso, I want to emphasize that I'm looking specifically for resources to help *faculty* (and departments or department leaders). I see a fair amount out there (on Reddit and beyond) targeted towards students (\"how to deal with a bad supervisor,\" etc.).\n\nBut I haven't been able to find as much targeted towards faculty (\"how to run a successful prelim\" or \"how to deal with conflicts among committee members\" or \"how to work with a student struggling with mental illness  - or with procrastination, writer's block, or shyness\" or \"how to intervene in a dysfunctional advising relationship,\" etc.) or towards departments (\"how to cultivate best practices for advising,\" etc.).\n\nIt seems to me that these are really difficult tasks, and most of us don't really get any training in this, other than observing our own advisors. Also, a PhD dissertation is a relatively long-term relationship - so sometimes these dysfunctional relationships can linger for years.\n\nIf you know of helpful resources (or past threads in this subreddit), I'd be very grateful if you could share them!",

        "post": "I just got diagnosed with ADHD - Primarily Inattentive at 36.  I'm an Assistant Professor and was wondering what kind of accommodations I can ask for.   I have a private office, I set boundaries about when I am accessible / available in person and via email.  I have extensive organizational systems to try to keep on top of all the tasks required to teach and manage a course.  I have recently requested to only teach 1 prep next year.  I do not have an open door policy.  If students request things verbally, I ask them to send me a follow up email as a reminder.  I only work with one student at a time during office hours.  Teaching lab sections are overwhelming, but I am trying to put in place classroom practices to make it less so.  What am I missing?\n\nI feel like some of these things that I require to function may look bad from other faculty and students.  Like, other professors respond to emails on the weekend or have an open door policy, and by me not being available will hurt my student evaluations.  I feel like I have begrudging support from other faculty members in the department.  Like it has been suggested multiple times that having office hours on Sunday or in the evenings would help with my evals.  I've pushed back, but maybe if I had it as part of an official accommodation it would be easier?  \n\nLast, I'm pre-tenure. I don't think I need an extension, but I was wondering if there are other accommodations I could ask for in the tenure process?  \n\nAlso, it would be great to hear from other faculty who have ADHD in general.  It can be a little isolating. <3",

        "post": "This has been the worst semester I have had in almost 20 years. The writing quality was awful and on the first written assignment I caught 10% of my class (class has 140 students) either plagiarizing, using direct quotes in correctly, as in writing what you want and then putting it into direct quotes, or using AI.\n\nI teach cognitive psychology which does deal with AI so I outlined how to cite AI which includes the AI model used, what prompts were used and then AI output. Under no circumstances is AI to ever be used for the student's own writing. \n\nSo I create assignments with what I call traps. For example, if there are 7 questions, I will make sure 4 can't be answered with AI like having to cite a video. So then I have a nice writing sample comparison right in the assignment. I also use ChatGPT and created a bot, kind of a virtual TA, and fed it several hundred anonymized writing samples from previous classes so it knows what college writing looks like. In other words, it's easy to catch students. If I suspect a violation of academic integrity, I always meet with them on Zoom before I decide what's going to happen.\n\nIn the end, it took me almost 40 hours to grade 1 assignment because when I grade, I feel compelled to provide feedback on what lost them points and how to correct it.\n\nA lot of students don't follow directions, their writing quality is so much worse, and they don't understand the basics of writing in science fields.\n\nI am legit disturbed. I explained to the class that even university presidents could lose their job and career over this stuff and they are seniors at a University. After awhile it started to sink in, but it took way too much of my time and effort to get seniors in college to understand why writing properly and citing correctly is a good thing.\n\nAnd I wonder if anyone else has noticed this in their students.",

        "post": "I'm getting yelled at from multiple directions because I've procrastinated my 15 or so mandatory training modules. A couple are helpful, but many are basically corporate ass-covering (\"Information security is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY\", \"Remember that children on campus are NOT COVERED by the campus protection policy unless they are with an AUTHORIZED ACTIVITY...\"). Occasionally, whoever orders these things doesn't even check to make sure they even apply to universities (\"Job efficiency is JOB ONE for every employee, from your CEO down to the janitor\").\n\nAny tips for minimizing the time I spend doing these? I'm looking at 10-20 hours of my life every year, completely uncompensated, and I'd prefer not make it a lot less, if possible.\n\n*Edit*: Y'all are awesome. Thanks for the tips. I don't think I can be the person who farms this out to someone else (like, there is actually some helpful info in these trainings, between the corporate cruft), but some of your hints seem very useful to me.\n\n*Edit 2*: After carefully noting all the great suggestions here, I went to do my very-procrastinated trainings... and they were gone! Of course we switched to a different system last September, the third or fourth compliance training system in the past six years, and this time they apparently decided to put compliance on the calendar year rather than academic year schedule. I then got another nastygram saying I was out of compliance as of January 1. I replied that I was trying to do them, and an hour later the modules magically appeared in my compliance website \"dashboard\" again. I cracked my knuckles and prepared to follow y'all's advice, and then... every time I clicked a compliance module it glitched: a weird half-second blob of server text followed by \"This module is no longer available.\" I was a bit freaked (\"insubordination\" is one of the things you can get fired for, tenure or not, and I wondered if this counted) but then I noticed that each module was showing as \"completed.\" So I spent all of 2 minutes clicking modules, seeing \"not available,\" then seeing \"completed.\"\n\nI worry I am being [reinforced](https://y.yarn.co/728c3904-4d75-42b6-bcf6-6d21a7e1789d_text.gif) for the wrong things...",

        "post": "Hello fellow educators of r/Professors,\n\nI come to you today with a perplexing phenomenon that has been unfolding in my virtual classroom. It involves those cryptic ellipses\u2014those three little dots\u2014that students seem to wield with both cunning and curiosity.\n\nPicture this: a student submits a discussion post, and there it is\u2014a solitary period, a dot, a full stop. But wait! A few minutes later, like a digital chameleon, the post morphs. The dot vanishes, replaced by a well-crafted response. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re playing hide-and-seek with their own words.\n\n**Why, oh why, do they do this?** Here are some theories I\u2019ve concocted in my cunny-fueled musings:\n\n1. **The Sneaky Surveyors:** Perhaps these students are secret surveyors, peeking at their peers\u2019 posts before committing their own. They want to know what\u2019s out there, like cautious explorers venturing into the academic wilderness.\n2. **The Time Travelers:** Could it be that they\u2019re bending the space-time continuum? Post first, edit later\u2014because who wouldn\u2019t want to impress their classmates with a response from the future? \u201cBehold, my eloquence transcends mere linear time!\u201d\n3. **The Deadline Dancers:** Ah, the thrill of procrastination! Picture this: 11:59 PM\u2014the witching hour. A lone dot appears. Then, like Cinderella\u2019s carriage, a fully formed post emerges at 1:20 AM. It\u2019s like they\u2019re racing against the clock, fueled by adrenaline and the promise of a grade.\n4. **The Formatting Fanatics:** Maybe they\u2019re perfectionists, fretting over font size, paragraph breaks, and MLA citations. They want their posts to shimmer like freshly polished apples. So, they peek, they tweak, and they emerge with posts worthy of a typographical symphony.\n5. **The Cunny Copycat:** Imagine a student reading a brilliant post, eyes wide with admiration. \u201cI must channel this genius!\u201d they declare. And so, they edit\u2014transforming their dot into a mirror reflecting someone else\u2019s brilliance.\n\nNow, dear colleagues, how do we respond? Should we embrace the ellipses, allowing this digital dance to continue? Or should we lock down the edit button, thwarting their temporal escapades?\n\nShare your wisdom, your tales, and your best eye-roll moments. Let\u2019s unravel the mystery of the dot-dot-dots together!\n\n*P.S. To the student who once submitted a dot at 11:59 PM and a masterpiece at 1:20 AM: You\u2019ve left your mark on the annals of academia. Bravo.*",

        "post": "Is it appropriate to play J.K. Rowling speeches in class?  I don't know what to do with cancel culture...\n\nI'm teaching a unit on narrative style to a class of first-years.  I've used an assignment for the past few years in which students choose between 4 TED Talks to write on how the speaker uses narrative style to get their message across to a professional/potentially academic audience.  This worked great virtually because students could just choose one video that interests them and essentially ignore the rest.  Now that we're back in the classroom, I decided to play all four videos during class for exposure and then let them decide which they want to write about.   The second video I played was a short talk by a trans activist, Samy Nour Younes, titled \"A Short History of Trans People's Long Fight for Equality.\" The fourth video was J.K. Rowling's 2008 Harvard commencement speech on \"The Fringe Benefits of Failure,\" which, despite Rowling's cultural crimes, still has such a valuable message for first-years on how to look differently at failure. (For context, the other two videos were \"Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator\" by Tim Urban and \"3 Ways to Speak English\" by Jamila Lyiscott)\n\nI prefaced the Rowling speech with a disclaimer on what I wrote above, that despite her crimes, the message in this 2008 speech is still worthwhile, but that if it doesn't feel comfortable for anyone, they are welcome to take care of themselves and leave class early and to choose a different speaker to write about.  Before I could get through my disclaimer, a student raised their hand and denounced that it \"wasn't cool\" to play Rowling after the previous video.  I thanked the student for their perspective and repeated my disclaimer, then began the video.\n\nThe student stayed, but typed vigorously on their phone through the video.  I felt a twinge of regret in playing the video because it's important to me that students feel safe, heard, and welcomed in my class.  But, I also wasn't prepared, nor did I feel it worthwhile at this point in the semester (it's our first week back on campus after 2 weeks virtual) to engage in a potentially long class-wide dialogue on cancel culture -- this can perhaps come at a later date, but right now, I need to meet some course outcomes.  I did state, in a welcoming tone, at the end of class that I'd be in my office if anyone wanted to discuss my choice of videos; the student did not do so.\n\nBut, this experience has prompted me to wonder how we approach potentially troublesome authors, researchers, and/or material within academia without laborious convos about cancel culture - do we give a brief statement and move forward (in my case, keeping the Rowling speech in as part of the course), or do we remove the trouble, ascribing to cancel culture (in my case, deleting the Rowling speech from future classes, despite its useful message)?  Would you recommend I reach out to the concerned student or give the student space in the next class to discuss their concern?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: After thinking about my post and reading some responses, I want to clarify my question: it  isn't about whether it's okay to show controversial material in class, it's about how to approach material by an author or researcher who has known lack of sensitivity toward a particular group of  humans' real lived experiences and perspectives.\n\nI appreciate the perspectives on the use of the term \"cancel culture\" as perpetuating it; I hadn't thought of that but was using language I figured students would understand.

Here's the most mentioned: too many courses/course work, unable to recall/comprehend the book,  wanting quizzes after the lecture to use notes, And lastly, not having to identify the specific correct answers (???)\n\nHere is what I provide to them every week: a study guide (where if they fill it out when they read they will have all the answers to the quiz questions each week). The idea is if they do this they come to class prepared to discuss the material and have a pretty easy decent grade on a quiz. Additionally, all quizzes are multiple choice and true and false. \n\nI understand that trying to get students to read is kind of a fools errand these days, but I wanted to throw the question out there to see what approach I can take going forward in class and what advice I might be able to give to my students. I feel they are beginning to take advantage of me and trying to get the class to be as easy as possible with as little work as possible. \n\nI have already done lectures on time management, planning, procrastination, and even crisis management, of which I try to relate not only from what we're there to study but also to their own lives right now, but generally seems to fly over their heads.

I had similar experiences with a particular category of assignment in my classes last year. Unsurprisingly, my strategy of taking two minutes out of every class to *plead* with them to get it done early twice a week for nearly three months didn't work. However, the objectives and spirit of the assignment necessitate that students be able to choose which weekly topic they want to write about. Rather than getting rid of the flexible deadline entirely, this upcoming semester I'm thinking of having them do a planning activity at the beginning of the semester, requiring them to set their own deadlines. These deadlines won't be enforced, but I'm hoping that it will at least make some dent in the proportion of students who wait until (after the) very last minute.\n\nThe learning experts all say that explaining the rationale for a given item of teaching can be helpful, so I'm trying to come up with a script for my TAs or a Youtube video or something that will impress upon students the importance of planning and the evils of procrastination in way that actually (somewhat) registers. I'm here soliciting recommendations for resources, information, or strategies that you have used to at least moderate effect? Thank you!",

        "post": "I'm an adjunct professor in an IT course that is taught online. Each semester, there are lab assignments that can be challenging and it's not unusual to set up several Zoom meetings with students to help them troubleshoot.\n\nIn the many years I've been teaching this course, there are always several students who wait until 2 hours before the due date (midnight, end of week) to get started, hit a wall, and then e-mail me pleading for help. When I was new, I would stay up to help them. I'd be having Zoom calls or exchanging e-mails at 11 PM.\n\nI eventually got tired of staying up late, sacrificing sleep or time with family/friends to help students who were clearly not taking ownership of their education. I began making it clear in the syllabus and class announcements, in bold, red text: Labs should be started when they are assigned to allow plenty of time for troubleshooting before the due date. The professor is not available late at night to answer last minute inquiries. Late submissions receive a zero. I also make this clear in the video lectures where I walk through the lab with a screen recording, step by step.\n\nDespite all of these warnings, there are still always a small handful of students who wait until the last minute, and I enforce the policy. They get a zero and a reminder about all the warnings that were given. They usually don't make the mistake again, but it still makes a B the best mathematically possible grade they can get - it's a hard lesson.\n\nThis semester, *more than half* of my students waited until the last minute and didn't turn anything in. I just doled out *a dozen* zeroes. Normally I don't lose much sleep over this policy, but when it's the *majority* of students, I have to wonder... what else can I do? How can I make it more clear that they have a week to work on this assignment and can't start it at the last minute and still expect credit?",

        "post": "There are two university libraries near my office.   I sometimes go to one or the other to work when I get tired of sitting in my office.  \n\nNow I've noticed that at one library I have to open  my backpack and show the security guard its contents only when I enter, but at the other library I only have to show my bag when I leave.  As I check in, find a table, and get seated, I'm often left pondering why this is.  \n\nPerhaps library 1 has lots of things that are valuable but not easily vulnerable to theft (e. g.  nice tables, murals, etc.) so they are most concerned about me bringing food/drink/spray paint etc.  that might be a danger to those things.  Whereas library 2 may have more stealable things (books, rare collections) so theft is the main concern there.  \n\nThe odd thing is that library 2, but not library 1, has an RF tag system at the exit that will beep if you pass through with a book.  So screening at exit is redundant as far as books are concerned. \n\nAnd why not check at both entry and exit?  Both libraries have 3 security guards at the entrance, of whom 2 don't seem to be doing anything.  \n\nHow does it work at your library?  \n\nIn case you're wondering, yes this post is a form of procrastination to avoid grading.

        "post": "A low stakes question for the forum that I am absolutely using to procrastinate proofreading my article proofs this morning.\n\nOver the years I have accumulated a fairly large library of digital resources - articles, ebooks, scanned primary sources like censuses and excavation notes, unpublished materials like curator reports... about 15.5 gigs at current count. Many of them are actually sources I use regularly, and some of them are things I'll never be able to get my hands on again if I nuke them now, so firebombing the directory from orbit is, while tempting, not a reasonable solution.\n\nAnd yes, there are absolutely duplicates in there which I'm slowly weeding out. My tendency to go find another copy of an article and download it again rather than sift through my own library is what proved that it's beyond time for a big cleanup.\n\nThey're semi-organized by subject at the moment, but my folders are haphazard at best and there's often overlap between the categories; they grew organically, but it now makes it tricky to figure out where to file something. (Is this material culture, or is it Atlantic history - it's both, so where do I stick it...) And I've still got some project-specific folders like \"Post-doc secondary sources articles\" to break apart and refile.\n\nRight now I'm using astrogrep to find things, since it lets me search the body of documents for text strings, but that relies on me remembering a quote or title correctly, and takes too long.\n\nSo here's the question for y'all - **how do you organize your digital hoarding piles**? I definitely need to take some time and rename the endless GHGLLG13321.28324.BLAHBLAH.pdf filenames into author\\_title.pdf, but what about the sorting itself? Library of Congress subject headers for folders? Dewey decimal? What are your tricks for keeping this stuff manageable?\n\nEdited to add: I'm a Windows user, so Mac-only software solutions are unfortunately not going to work.",

I'm too tired from grading and sick with a miserable cold to solve this mystery.\n\nAll of my exams are short answer, not take-home. I have two students who turned in final exams with identical answers. I would say 95% of their answers are identical. 11 of 13 answers are word for word. Even down to spelling mistakes and odd phrasing. The wording is so exact on so many questions that I don't believe it's possible for one student to have occasionally glanced at the other student's paper to copy.\n\nI believe they both cheated.\n\nI actually have no idea how they pulled it off. I can't recall where everyone was sitting in the room during the exam. I believe one student was sitting at a table behind the other. It's 98 students in a big room with only me to watch them, but they were pretty spread out. I doubt they had a copy of the exam early. These are not recycled questions, and the exam basically didn't exist until the night before the final (because I procrastinate like that). Some of the handwriting on the two is suspiciously similar, but also looks different in other places, and like each student's handwriting on previous exams. I can't tell\u2014I'm no handwriting expert. Though sometimes I wish I was...\n\nI think the most likely explanation is that one student wrote both exams. But then why copy the answers exactly? Maybe one finished early and handed theirs to the other student to copy? I don't know. My institution tends to give students a ton of chances, and I basically have to go in with absolute proof to make any impact.\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "post": "This is a question that I've been kicking around since starting to procrastinate on last semester's grading. The flipped classroom basically says to put the main instruction part of the course at home, and have more homework type work take place in class.\n\nThe typical literature course involves students reading at home, and then engaging in discussions about interpretation, theme, etc, all the nuances of the work, in class. That sounds like a flipped classroom to me, even though it's also the tradition way these classes are taught.\n\nLet me try to explain this by unflipping the lit course, bring the homework to class, send the classwork home.\n\nYou'd come into class, and the professor would walk you through the text, explaining all the events and characters, and probably reading a lot of whole passages. Then, you'd be given a homework assignment to write a short essay analyzing the story. That seems to fit the normal \"unflipped\" model by placing the primary instruction (reading the text) in the classroom.\n\nBut, probably due mostly to time constraints, lit classes have already moved the primary part of instruction to home. In class, you'll typically have a discussion that looks a lot like basically figuring out an essay.\n\nAm I totally off base here? Am I missing something?\n\n[Note I'm not saying all courses with reading at home are inherently flipped. I think literature is unique in that students are expected to not just read at home, but to get a certain level of competence with the material on their own. The basics of the texts might never be explicitly stated in a class lecture. Very different from reading before having the same material largely repeated in a lecture.]",

There it is. I have just enough time remaining to log in, fix those final few items, upload it all, ponder various life decisions that have led to this time, and watch an episode of Parks and Rec before bed.",
